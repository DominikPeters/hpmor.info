        popular, then it would be very hard to Peggy Sue HPMOR. So the mysterious
        whisper is also potentially a Reverse Peggy Sue plot hook, as the final
        whisper originating from the disastrous universe where Harry never met
        Hermione.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        I never did find a good place for Harry and Hermione to talk about how many
        wizards, not just seers, might feel rather vague pressures in the presence of
        temporally important things... but because so many different people claimed to
        feel that they needed to do something important, or that they sure knew how
        the future would go, and then were proven wrong, this more widespread temporal
        sense became Disreputable and Low-Status. And so the High-Status thing to
        claim was that only Official Seers ever had anything to do with prophecy, and
        make fun of anyone not an Official Seer who claimed to feel any kind of
        temporal pressure, and the textbooks all said it was only seers.
      </p>
      <p>Although I did manage to put in this one part in Ch. 116:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          She was aware, in the back of her mind, that if the Quidditch rules really
          did change starting here and now, then this was the most important thing
          she'd ever do. She could almost feel the pressure of Time twisting around
          her as though the fate of Quidditch Itself were being settled this very day,
          and she was standing close to the center of it... though she hadn't gotten
          high-enough scores in Divination to actually sense anything like that, of
          course.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>And of course there's this in Ch. 88:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          He should have slowed down for safety, but there was a tension rising in
          him, a sourceless dread. He couldn't slow down, something terrible would
          happen if he slowed down...
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>and</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          The pressure in Harry's mind still rising, like a physical hand squeezing
          his chest, he had to find Hermione and he had no other notion of where she
          could be
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        So yes, the model in HPMOR has always been that in moments of sufficiently
        great temporal pressure, non-seers can also feel something.

          think about what he was saying, I don't think he would have used any word
          close to "Crucio." The stutter came when his conscious mind finished wrongly
          the beginning of the word that his subconscious mind had chosen for him to
          say. This is not the only instance where thoughts inherited from Voldemort
          affect Harry's thinking. Notice how he uses the first names of Lucius and
          Severus from the beginning, and he instinctively understands their dangerous
          natures.</span

        Lastly, it took me aaaaages to come up with a working theory about what the
        letter from Lucius meant. Basically, Harry has such an accurate read on Lucius
        that Lucius doesn't think he could know that without being an ally of Snape.
        Draco knows that this isn't true, he knows that Harry has never met the man,
        and that means that Harry is even more impressive than he previously believed.
        It feels like this was supposed to communicate something, but it definitely
        wasn't obvious to me, and this is my best guess.

          It's another Harrymort clue. Harry forms uncannily accurate impressions of
          known Death Eaters from little information, but only from the perspective of

        FYI, the Sorting Hat in HPMOR makes its predictions of future outcomes by
        something more akin to distance-weighted k-nearest-neighbor, using what
        present and past Headmasters have known as the outcome for past students who
        passed through it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course that particular prediction algorithm can deliver weird results in
        some special cases, like if the boy under your brim seems insanely close in
        the metric space to exactly one past student, whose outcome is "worst Dark
        Wizard in centuries".

        Incidentally, and this was always the intended explanation, the real reason
        the Hat is so worried about Harry is that... the Hat uses a kernel algorithm
        to extrapolate outcomes from previous students. /mike drop.

    Harry was still trying to process everything that had happened during the

    instant Harry had lifted the Hat off his head; in that moment, he'd heard a tiny
    whisper as though from nowhere, something that sounded oddly like English and a
    hiss at the same time, something that had said, "<em>Ssalutations from
    Sslytherin to Sslytherin: if you would sseek my ssecretss, sspeak to my

        We know Ron talked to Fred and George on Platform 9 3/4 right after talking
        to Harry; see Chapter 25: "Ron had told them about Harry being weird and evil"
      </p>
      <p>
        There's also evidence that Dumbledore is in the habit of legilimency on Fred
        and George. It's suggested in Fred & George's aftermath in Chapter 63, "It
        wasn't that the Headmaster had popped up out of nowhere and was staring at
        them with a stern expression. Dumbledore was always doing that", and more
        heavily implied in Chapter 79, with Dumbledore knowing about the marauder's map.
      </p>
      <p>
        This suggests: Ron told F&G about Harry wanting to do away with the snitch, and
        Dumbledore read F&G's minds shortly after they arrived at Hogwarts that evening.
      </p>
      <p>
        This hypothesis also paints a clearer picture of the Skeeter prank: We know Fred
        and George had help from someone, because they were obliviated afterwards.
        Dumbledore had some reason to give them an expensive gift after the fact.
        Dumbledore also has a motive to smack down Skeeter, because she belongs to
        Lucius. If he reads their minds, then he'd be in a position to help them memory
        charm Skeeter.

      <p>
        Oh, ye of far too little faith. The paper said "DO NOT MESS WITH TIME" because
        time travel in HPMOR works by a global post-selection rule, and this local
        outcome prevented the future paradoxes Harry would have produced if he had
        been less scared out of messing with Time. In other words,
        <em>globally</em> consistent timelines had to contain a
        <em>locally</em> self-consistent loop saying "DO NOT MESS WITH TIME" or
        something along those lines, instead of a <em>locally</em> consistent loop
        with the prime factors being written down, because apparent success in that

      <p>I think the implied timeline of events is:</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Lord Voldemort shows up to the monastery, as Quirrell describes, but
            slaughters everyone (not everyone less one survivor).

        </li>
        <li>

            David Monroe, the "sole survivor" who "was there" (who exactly can

          That's the intended interpretation; modulo that it wasn't <em>just</em> Rule
          Twelve, it was also how Tom Riddle was taught to lose. He did not learn
          <em>exactly</em> what the master hoped. He understood exactly what the lesson
          was meant to teach, for he is not foolish, but that is not the same as
          agreeing with the originally intended lesson.

        If Tom had destroyed the monastery on the spot, as Voldemort pretended to do,
        he would indeed have shown weakness. As it is, by Tom's lights, he showed his
        patience, got his revenge eventually, removed the source of knowledge from
        potential competitors, and built another brick in the story of Voldemort that
        would cause people to underestimate the real Tom in a way he could predict.

        Hey, I was wondering if you could confirm one other small thing that's been
        nagging at me.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Quirrell uses the starlight spell, Harry notes that he can't even
        comprehend the incantation. I recall a few other similar situations in the
        story where he couldn't understand the spells either. The one I mentioned
        against the auror, another was Dumbledore's giant fire bird at Azkaban I
        believe.
      </p>
      <p>
        My question is, was this audio distortion of incantations meant to be an
        effect of the interdict of Merlin? In all those cases it certainly seems
        plausible to me that those particular magic's were that powerful.

        I would guess that there is probably some sort of hashing system set up: As
        in, specific random words paired with specific random gestures would result in
        specific random spell effects. While a swish and flick while saying Wingardium
        Leviosa can get an object to float, there is likely a far more difficult to
        pronounce word that requires holding steady.

          Yep, inventing a spell is really 'finding' it in a big spell-space. The
          particular point found, among many alternatives, depends on the sort of words
          <em>you</em> look for.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively, when a spell is invented for the first time, it gets carved
          into the system of magic at that time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those were my own two running hypotheses for "Wingardium Leviosa". As a
          distant third, that the laws of magic depend on a widespread averaged
          expectation.

        I didn't want to pick a real address in Oxford and have people start showing
        up there, which seemed like a possibility given the size of HPMOR fandom. I
        didn't like the idea of having an address that was definitely not really in
        Oxford, or an address that was really FHI or some other non-residential
        address. So I, personally, think of their house as just somewhere-in-Oxford,
        since the story never demanded it to be more specific. But you're welcome to
        pick any solution you like.

      <p>Lucius starts out talking to Voldemort.</p>

          hardening. "If my suspicions are true, you would hardly do Dumbledore's

        </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>There was a slight pause.</p>
        <p>
          "So you know," Harry said, his voice cold. "Tell me. At which point,
          exactly, did you realize?"
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        This of course is Harry bluffing his way through a conversation he doesn't
        understand. Given Lucius's prior belief, and the actual background truths
        leading Harry to use that particular tone of voice, this tactic works
        excellently.
      </p>
      <p>
        After some amount of conversation, Lucius suddenly hears Voldemort say the
        spectacularly out-of-character line:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "I find it interesting," Harry said, putting steel into his own voice, "that
          you think I could benefit from doing Draco harm. But it is irrelevant,
          Lucius. <em>He</em> is my friend, and I do not betray my friends."
        </p>
        <p>"<em>What?</em> " whispered Lucius. His face showed sheer shock.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        After some further events and interaction with Augusta Longbottom, Lucius
        hears the line:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "I think not. I prefer to deal with the part of House Malfoy that's my own
          age."
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        This line makes no sense for Voldemort having a cryptic conversation with
        Lucius; it only makes sense for "Harry Potter". Which causes Lucius to
        suddenly realize that this whole time he's been talking to a Voldemort
        <em>staying in character</em> as Harry Potter, not giving away or admitting
        anything; a Voldemort who is therefore <em>pretending</em> to be Harry Potter
        fishing for information while bluffing his way through a conversation he
        doesn't understand.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "Of course..." said Lucius slowly. "I do feel the fool now. This whole time
          you were just pretending to have no idea what we were talking about."
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        In actuality, of course, Lucius is dealing with Harry Potter fishing for
        information while bluffing his way through a conversation he doesn't
        understand.
      </p>

        something like a suggestion or hint of that to Hermione, though in very vague

        Something no one else has mentioned in a particularly clear way, though AdShea
        did mention Harry's "brain-hypervisor", is that Harry can't hear the dementors
        for the same reason that he can't see them. The dementors are "trying" (for
        lack of a better term) to convince the people around them that they're "dead
        things left in water", but they aren't really that. And Harry's training to
        avoid accepting falsehoods prevents him from being affected by that part of
        the dementors' magical effect.

        I took it to refer to the Dementor informing the aurors of Bellatrix's escape.
        If Harry had re-cast his Patronus before it was too late, the Dementors would
        have lost sight of Bellatrix and no longer realized she was free. Then Harry
        would have been able to complete the mission successfully using the original
        escape plan.

        If I had to take a guess, Harry has just been confronted with a multitude of
        horrors that he'd previously been ignorant of, that he had to defeat entirely
        by himself. He's just been forced to grow up in a devastating way, and here he
        really wants to find something childish and normal to get a little bit back of
        what he lost. He's also probably wondering if he'd be happier if he was more
        innocent and less intelligent, but a minute of honest interaction with his
        best friend reaffirms to him that he will be fine, and that his intelligence
        and education are parts of him that he doesn't want to ever give up.

    about such rituals - whether or not you choose to term them Dark - is that they
    are shaped to be magically efficacious, not to appear impressive when performed.
    I suppose there is a certain tendency for the more powerful rituals to require
    more dreadful sacrifices. Even so, the most terrible ritual known to me demands
    only a rope which has hanged a man and a sword which has slain a woman; and that
    for a ritual which promised to summon Death itself - though what is truly meant
    by that I do not know and do not care to discover, since it was also said that
    the counterspell to dismiss Death had been lost. The most dread chant I have
    encountered does not sound even a hundredth as fearsome as the chant you
    composed for Miss Davis. Those among the bullies who had a passing familiarity
    with Dark rituals - and I am certain that there were some - must have been
    terrified beyond the capacity of words to describe. If there existed a true

        components required for the spell are an athame, dragon's blood, serpent's
        venom, <strong>a sword that's slain a woman</strong>,
        <strong>a rope that's hanged a man</strong>, a shallow silver bowl, a golden
        thimble, and a reckless disregard for the continued existence of the World.
      </p>
      <p>
        Described as a "contagious lack of thing-ness," the bubbling, viscous goo
        created by the spell expands rapidly along areas of solid material but
        relatively slowly through air. It is believed that unchecked, this spell would
        destroy the World. It is only known to have been used three times; the first
        two times it was stopped with a countercharm.
        <strong>The original countercharm has since been lost.</strong>

    essentially humanlike emotions, many were known to interbreed with humans. Harry
    had already reasoned out that magic didn't create new intelligence but just
    changed the shape of genetically human beings. Unicorns were equinoid, were not
    even partially humanoid, didn't talk, used no tools, they were almost certainly
    just magical horses. If it was right to eat a cow to feed yourself for a day,

    After a time Professor Quirrell picked up the next Potions ingredient, a strand
    of what looked like unicorn hair. "I tell you this as a caution," said Professor
    Quirrell. "Do not expect me to be delayed another nine years, if you somehow
    destroy this body of mine. I set horcruxes in better places at once, and now
    even that is unnecessary. Thanks to you, I learned where to find the
    Resurrection Stone. The Resurrection Stone does not bring back the dead, of
    course; but it holds a more ancient magic than my own for projecting the seeming
    of a spirit. And since I am one who has defeated death, Cadmus's Hallow
    acknowledged me its master, and answered all my will. I have now incorporated it
    into my great creation." Professor Quirrell smiled slightly. "I had many years
    earlier considered making that device a horcrux, but decided against it at the

    ironies does life play upon us. But I digress. <em>You</em>, boy, you brought
    that about, you freed my spirit to fly where it pleases and seduce the most
    opportune victim, by being too casual with your secrets. It is a catastrophe for
    any who oppose me, and you wrought it with one finger drawing wetness on a tea-

        <li>Makes diary from Myrtle.</li>

        </li>
        <li>Completes Horcrux 2.</li>
        <li>
          Realizes that Horcrux 2s no longer need to be left where they can be found
          (so far as he knows).

        <li>Makes Horcrux 2s from shiny things, hides them behind Inferi.</li>
        <li>
          Gets older, realizes younger self was bloody idiot and failed to update
          strategy fully, starts mass-manufacturing Horcrux 2s from pebbles and
          portkeying them into the sea. Retrieves Horcrux 1s, hides all except one
          final Horcrux 1 fallback in very secure location only undone if he goes
          missing for long time.
        </li>
        <li>Tries to use Horcrux 1 spell on Harry, fails.</li>
        <li>Quirrell founds old Horcrux 2 generated in step 6.</li>

          So that Harry could take the Unbreakable Vow, which used his wand. If not for
          Partial Transfiguration, that would have been relatively safe. Voldemort still
          underestimated Harry's threat level, in the end.
        </p>
        <p>
          I remark that the thought occurred to me later that if I were Voldemort I
          would have some Death Eaters looking outward, not everyone looking just at
          Harry... but nobody called <em>that</em> out as stupid, because you were told
          not to expect cavalry. Hindsight bias really is a thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          EDIT: Observe replies below saying "Voldemort should've taken away the wand."
          If Harry's glasses had contained something interesting instead, people would
          be saying, "Take away the glasses."
        </p>
        <p>
          I did look at the text to see if there was a natural place to insert Voldemort
          saying "Drop the wand now" after ordering his Death Eaters to vigilance again,
          with Harry refusing and Voldemort just continuing as before, but there didn't
          seem to be a natural such place.

        So to everyone who came here to post about how Harry should have tried to call
        someone in to Frigideiro and Transfigure the Death Eater's heads for later
        attempted revival...
      </p>
      <p>Harry hasn't thought of that yet.</p>
      <p>
        He hasn't yet spent enough time thinking about the information-theoretic
        criterion of death that he <em>automatically</em> looks at the recently
        severed head of a dead body and sees someone who's still alive and in need of
        saving.
      </p>
      <p>
        Harry is going to think of it a week later, maybe, while he's going through it
        in his head wondering if there was something better he could have done. I
        think that's what's realistic, all things considered. I didn't see that option
        for at least a day after I plotted out that point, so Harry shouldn't see it
        instantly either, especially when he's busy trying to not think about the
        awful thing he just did, or properly manage the guilt the way his model of
        Moody says he should.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sure is pointlessly tragic, huh? If only wizards did this sort of thing more
        often, so that Harry wasn't the only one who apprehended the possibility. By
        the way, everyone who came here to post about how Harry should have tried to
        call someone in to Frigideiro and Transfigure the heads, you
        <em>have</em> actually taken the time and undergone the minor inconvenience to
        sign up yourself and your loved ones up for cryonics. <em>Right?</em> Because
        it would be even <em>more</em> pointlessly ironic and tragic if you wrote
        about how silly it was for Harry to miss that, and then you didn't do anything
        about it yourself. Sort of like if I'd shown Harry criticizing a stage play
        where someone else had failed to preserve the severed heads of their enemies
        and the information inside, and then Harry himself didn't try to cool down
        Hermione in the crisis and just let her die. Hint hint HINT <em>HINT</em>

        The "destroyer of worlds" bit isn't referring to anything specific, it is to
        refer to global existential threats as the kind of problem that Harry suspects
        the Elder Wand was designed to solve. The Cloak of Invisibility accepted Harry
        as the heir of Ignotus Peverell after he had destroyed Death in its form as a
        Dementor, and revealed its true capabilities to him, as he had mastered it and
        could now detect its presence easily. The Resurrection Stone accepted Riddle
        as the Heir of Cadmus Peverell after he survived the death of his body,

        The Elder Wand was designed for something else: global threats to the whole
        species. The obvious use of it is to be a straight up power boost so the
        strongest wizard available is well defended against such a large threat. But
        Harry still wonders at what abilities it grants to an heir it acknowledges,
        especially since Dumbledore had probably been accepted as the heir of Antioch
        Peverell for his actions in trying to prevent the Death of the world, and
        received help in some way from it.
