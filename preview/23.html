It would mean waiting an extra hour for breakfast, but that was why he had
cereal bars. No, this idea absolutely positively had to be tested right away,
immediately, now.

Harry set the textbook aside, leapt out of bed, raced around his bed, yanked out
the cavern level of his trunk, ran down the stairs, and started moving boxes of
books around. (He really needed to unpack and get bookcases at some point but he
was in the middle of his textbook reading contest with Hermione and falling
behind so he hadn't had time.)

The other boys were getting ready to go down to breakfast in the Great Hall and
start the day.

"Excuse me can you do something for me?" said Harry. He was flipping through the
book's index as he spoke, found the page with the first ten thousand primes,
flipped to that page, and thrust the book at Anthony Goldstein. "Pick two three-
digit numbers from this list. Don't tell me what they are. Just multiply them
together and tell me the product. Oh, and can you do the calculation twice to
double-check? Please make really sure you've got the right answer, I'm not sure
what's going to happen to me or the universe if you make a multiplication
error."

</span>
It said a lot about what life in that dorm had been like over the past few days
that Anthony didn't even bother saying anything like "Why'd you suddenly flip
out?" or "That seems really weird, what are your reasons for asking?" or "What
do you mean, you're not sure what's going to happen to the universe?"
</p>
</div><div class="paragraph collapsible">

</span>
Anthony wordlessly accepted the book and took out a parchment and quill. Harry
spun around and shut his eyes, making sure not to see anything, dancing back and
forth and bouncing up and down with impatience. He got a pad of paper and a
mechanical pencil and got ready to write.
</p>
</div><div class="paragraph collapsible">
<p>
<a id="2435"></a><span class="para-number">2435 <a href="#2435" class="para-anchor">&para;</a>

"Okay," Anthony said, "One hundred and eighty-one thousand, four hundred and
twenty-nine."

Harry wrote down 181,429. He repeated what he'd just written down, and Anthony
confirmed it.

Then Harry raced back down into the cavern level of his trunk, glanced at his
watch (the watch said 4:28 which meant 7:28) and then shut his eyes.

</span>
Around thirty seconds later, Harry heard the sound of steps, followed by the
sound of the cavern level of the trunk sliding shut. (Harry wasn't worried about
suffocating. An automatic Air-Freshening Charm was part of what you got if you
were willing to buy a really good trunk. Wasn't magic wonderful, it didn't have
to worry about electric bills.)

And when Harry opened his eyes, he saw just what he'd been hoping to see, a
folded piece of paper left on the floor, the gift of his future self.

If Harry opened up Paper-2 and it was blank, then he would write "101 x 101"
down on Paper-1, fold it up, study for an hour, go back in time, drop off
Paper-1 (which would thereby become Paper-2), and head on up out of the cavern
level to join his dorm mates for breakfast.

Otherwise Harry would add 2 to the number on the right and write down the new
pair of numbers on Paper-1. Unless that made the number on the right greater
than 997, in which case Harry would add 2 to the number on the left and write
down 101 on the right.

If this worked, Harry could use it to recover any sort of answer that was easy
to check but hard to find. He wouldn't have <em>just</em> shown that P=NP once
you had a Time-Turner, this trick was <em>more general</em> than that. Harry
could use it to find the combinations on combination locks, or passwords of
every sort. Maybe even find the entrance to Slytherin's Chamber of Secrets, if
Harry could figure out some systematic way of describing all the locations in
Hogwarts. It would be an awesome cheat even by Harry's standards of cheating.

<p>
  Oh, ye of far too little faith. The paper said "DO NOT MESS WITH TIME" because
  time travel in HPMOR works by a global post-selection rule, and this local
  outcome prevented the future paradoxes Harry would have produced if he had
  been less scared out of messing with Time. In other words,
  <em>globally</em> consistent timelines had to contain a
  <em>locally</em> self-consistent loop saying "DO NOT MESS WITH TIME" or
  something along those lines, instead of a <em>locally</em> consistent loop
  with the prime factors being written down, because apparent success in that
  experiment would have caused Harry to try weirder experiments later.

Harry and all the other boys in the first year were outside on a grassy field
with Madam Hooch, standing next to the Hogwarts supply of broomsticks. The girls
would be learning to fly separately. Apparently, for some reason, girls didn't
want to learn how to fly on broomsticks in the presence of boys.

Harry had been a little wobbly all day long. He just couldn't seem to stop

Also: seriously, <em>broomsticks?</em> He was going to fly on, basically, a line
segment? Wasn't that pretty much the single most unstable shape you could
possibly find, short of attempting to hold on to a point marble? Who'd selected
<em>that</em> design for a flying device, out of all the possibilities? Harry
had been hoping that it was just a figure of speech, but no, they were standing
in front of what looked for all the world like ordinary wooden kitchen
broomsticks. Had someone just gotten stuck on the idea of broomsticks and failed
to consider anything else? It had to be. There was no way that the
<em>optimal</em> designs for cleaning kitchens and flying would happen to
coincide if you worked them out from scratch.

It was a clear day with a bright blue sky and a brilliant sun that was just

It took a while for everyone to get a broomstick in front of them. Madam Hooch

Harry sheathed his wand and raced forwards at full speed. He arrived at the
boy's side at the same time as Madam Hooch, and Harry reached into his pouch and
tried to recall oh god what was the name never mind he'd just try "Healer's
Pack!" and it popped up into his hand and -

The Emergency Healing Pack Plus lay open in front of him, and there was a
syringe of liquid fire in Harry's hand, which would have kept the boy's brain

Madam Hooch sent Harry a glare. "Of course not!" She pulled the boy to his feet
using his good arm - Harry saw with a shock that it was Neville Longbottom
<em>again,</em> what was <em>with</em> him? - and she turned to all the watching
children. "None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing!
You leave those brooms where they are or you'll be out of Hogwarts before you
can say 'Quidditch.' Come on, dear."

And Harry saw that Draco was strolling towards him, accompanied by Mr. Crabbe
and Mr. Goyle. Mr. Crabbe wasn't smiling. Mr. Goyle decidedly was. Draco himself
was wearing a very controlled face that twitched occasionally, from which Harry
inferred that Draco thought it was hilarious but saw no political advantage to
be gained by laughing about it now instead of in the Slytherin dungeons
afterwards.

"Well, Potter," Draco said in a low voice that didn't carry, still with that
very controlled face that was twitching occasionally, "Just wanted to say, when
you take advantage of emergencies to demonstrate leadership, you want to look
like you're in total control of the situation, rather than, say, going into a
complete panic." Mr. Goyle giggled, and Draco shot him a quelling look. "But you
probably scored a few points anyway. You need any help stowing that healer's
kit?"

Harry turned to look at the Healing Pack, which got his own face turned away
from Draco. "I think I'm fine," Harry said. He put the syringe back in its

"A good thought indeed," drawled Draco. "Why didn't anyone in Hufflepuff have

"Contest" had been as far as Harry's inspiration had gotten. What sort of

"Mr. Potter," said Professor McGonagall, "if you have discovered anything that

"<em>This isn't like you!</em> " Harry burst out. "I'm sorry but that just seems

"Go <em>wrong</em>, Mr. Potter? <em>I certainly hope not.</em>" Professor
McGonagall's face was expressionless. "After Professor Blake was caught in a
closet with no fewer than three fifth-year Slytherins last February, and a year
before that, Professor Summers failed so completely as an educator that her
students thought a boggart was a kind of furniture, it would be
<em>catastrophic</em> if some problem with the extraordinarily competent
Professor Quirrell came to my attention now, and I daresay most of our students
would fail their Defence O.W.L.s and N.E.W.T.s."

"I see," Harry said slowly, taking it all in. "So in other words, whatever's
wrong with Professor Quirrell, you desperately don't want to know about it until
the end of the school year. And since it's currently September, he could
assassinate the Prime Minister on live television and get away with it so far as

"Oh, I doubt that, Mr. Potter. I doubt that very much." Professor McGonagall
leaned forward, her face tightening again. "Since you and I have already
discussed matters far more sensitive than these, I shall speak frankly. You, and
you alone, have reported this mysterious sense of doom. You, and you alone, are
a chaos magnet the likes of which I have never seen. After our little shopping
trip to Diagon Alley, and <em>then</em> the Sorting Hat, and then
<em>today's</em> little episode, I can well foresee that I am fated to sit in
the Headmaster's office and hear some hilarious tale about Professor Quirrell in
which you and you alone play a starring role, after which there will be no
choice but to fire him. I am already resigned to it, Mr. Potter. And if this sad
event takes place any earlier than the Ides of May, I will string you up by the
gates of Hogwarts with your own intestines and pour fire beetles into your nose.
<em>Now</em> do you understand me completely?"

It was 5:32pm on Thursday afternoon, and Harry was standing next to Professor
Flitwick, in front of the great stone gargoyle that guarded the entrance to the
Headmaster's office.

No sooner had he made it back from Professor McGonagall's office to the
Ravenclaw study rooms than one of the students told him to report to Professor
Flitwick's office, and there Harry had learned that Dumbledore wanted to speak
to him.

"Please don't worry too much, Mr. Potter," squeaked Professor Flitwick from
somewhere around Harry's shoulder level. (Harry was grateful for Professor
Flitwick's gigantic puffy beard, it was hard getting used to a Professor who was
not only shorter than him but spoke in a higher-pitched voice.) "Headmaster
Dumbledore may seem a little odd, or a lot odd, or even extremely odd, but he
has never hurt a student in the slightest, and I don't believe he ever will."
Professor Flitwick gave Harry an encouraging smile. "Just keep that in mind at
all times and you'll be sure not to panic!"

"Good luck!" squeaked Professor Flitwick, and leaned over to the gargoyle and
said something that Harry somehow failed to hear at all. (Of course, the
password wouldn't be much good if you could hear someone saying it.) And the
stone gargoyle walked aside with a very natural and ordinary movement that Harry
found rather shocking, since the gargoyle still looked like solid, immovable
stone the whole time.

There were tiny metal mechanisms that whirred or ticked or slowly changed shape
or emitted little puffs of smoke. There were dozens of mysterious fluids in
dozens of oddly shaped containers, all bubbling, boiling, oozing, changing
color, or forming into interesting shapes that vanished half a second after you
saw them. There were things that looked like clocks with many hands, inscribed
with numbers or in unrecognisable languages. There was a bracelet bearing a
lenticular crystal that sparkled with a thousand colors, and a bird perched atop
a golden platform, and a wooden cup filled with what looked like blood, and a
statue of a falcon encrusted in black enamel. The wall was all hung with
pictures of people sleeping, and the Sorting Hat was casually poised on a
hatrack that was also holding two umbrellas and three red slippers for left
feet.

Dumbledore drew forth a small metal case and flipped it open, showing some small
yellow lumps. "Sherbet lemon?" said the Headmaster.

"Er, no thank you, Heh," said Harry. <em>Does slipping a student LSD count as
hurting them, or does that fall into the category of harmless fun?</em> "You,

madness?"

they are anymore. It was just a little remark."

"<em>Why?</em> " Dumbledore repeated. "Ah, Harry, if I went around all day

I'm quite a busy person, you know."

Harry nodded, smiling. "Yes, it was a very impressive list. Headmaster of
Hogwarts, Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, and Supreme Mugwump of the
International Confederation of Wizards. Sorry to ask but I was wondering, is it
possible to get more than six hours if you use more than one Time-Turner?
Because it's pretty impressive if you're doing all that on just thirty hours a
day."

There was another slight pause, during which Harry went on smiling. He was a
little apprehensive, actually a lot apprehensive, but once it had become clear
that Dumbledore was deliberately messing with him, something within him
<em>absolutely refused</em> to sit and take it like a defenceless lump.

"I'm afraid Time doesn't like being stretched out too much," said Dumbledore
after the slight pause, "and yet we ourselves seem to be a little too large for
it, and so it's a constant struggle to fit our lives into Time."

Then Dumbledore chuckled. "Straight to the point it shall be." The Headmaster
leaned forwards, tilting his squashed mushroom hat and brushing his beard
against his desk. "Harry, this Monday you did something that should have been
impossible even with a Time-Turner. Or rather, impossible with <em>only</em> a
Time-Turner. Where did those two pies come from, I wonder?"

</span>
A jolt of adrenaline shot through Harry. He'd done that using the Cloak of
Invisibility, the one that had been given him in a Christmas box along with a
note, and that note had said: <em>If Dumbledore saw a chance to possess one of
the Deathly Hallows he would never let it escape his grasp.</em><em>...</em>

</span>
"A natural thought," Dumbledore went on, "is that since none of the first-years
present were able to cast such a spell, someone else was present, and yet
unseen. And if no one could see them, why, it would be easy enough for them to
throw the pies. One might further suspect that since you had a Time-Turner, you
were the invisible one; and that since the spell of Disillusionment is far
beyond your current abilities, you had an invisibility cloak." Dumbledore smiled
conspiratorially. "Am I on the right track so far, Harry?"

Harry was frozen. He had the feeling that an outright lie would not at all be

else to say.

</span>
Dumbledore waved a friendly hand. "Don't worry, Harry, you haven't done anything
wrong. Invisibility cloaks aren't against the rules - I suppose they're rare
enough that no one ever got around to putting them on the list. But really I was
wondering something else entirely."

Dumbledore's eyes shone with enthusiasm. "You see, Harry, after you've been
through a few adventures you tend to catch the hang of these things. You start
to see the pattern, hear the rhythm of the world. You begin to harbour
suspicions <em>before</em> the moment of revelation. You are the Boy-Who-Lived,
and somehow an invisibility cloak made its way into your hands only four days
after you discovered our magical Britain. Such cloaks are not for sale in Diagon
Alley, but there is <em>one</em> which might find its own way to a destined
wearer. And so I cannot help but wonder if by some strange chance you have found
not just <em>an</em> invisibility cloak, but <em>the</em> Cloak of Invisibility,
one of the three Deathly Hallows and reputed to hide the wearer from the gaze of
Death himself." Dumbledore's gaze was bright and eager. "May I see it, Harry?"

</span>
Harry swallowed. There was a full flood of adrenaline in his system now and it
was entirely useless, this was the most powerful wizard in the world and there
was no way he could make it out the door and there was nowhere in Hogwarts for
him to hide if he did, he was about to lose the Cloak that had been passed down
through the Potters for who knew how long -

Slowly Dumbledore leaned back into his high chair. The bright light had gone out

Dumbledore, "if you don't want to, you can just say no."

distrust?"

Dumbledore shook his head slowly. "Unbreakable Vows are not to be used so
lightly. And besides, Harry, if you did not already know the spell, you would
have only my word that the spell was binding. Yet surely you realise that I do
not <em>need</em> your permission to see the Cloak. I am powerful enough to draw
it forth myself, mokeskin pouch or no." Dumbledore's face was very grave. "But
this I will not do. The Cloak is yours, Harry. I will not seize it from you. Not
even to look at for just a moment, unless you decide to show it to me. That is a
promise and an oath. Should I need to prohibit you from using it on the school
grounds, I will require you to go to your vault at Gringotts and store it
there."

"Ah..." Harry said. He swallowed hard, trying to calm the flood of adrenaline
and think reasonably. He took the mokeskin pouch off his belt. "If you really
<em>don't</em> need my permission... then you have it." Harry held out the pouch
to Dumbledore, and bit down hard on his lip, sending that signal to himself in
case he was Obliviated afterwards.

"Ah," breathed Dumbledore. "I was right..." He poured the shimmering black
velvet mesh through his hand. "Centuries old, and still as perfect as the day it
was made. We have lost much of our art over the years, and now I cannot make
such a thing myself, no one can. I can feel the power of it like an echo in my
mind, like a song forever being sung without anyone to hear it..." The wizard
looked up from the Cloak. "Do not sell it," he said, "do not give it to anyone
as a possession. Think twice before you show it to anyone, and ponder three
times again before you reveal it is a Deathly Hallow. Treat it with respect, for
this is indeed a Thing of Power."

"Oh, <em>Draco Malfoy!</em> " Harry said, feeling rather relieved that it wasn't
Hermione or something. "Oh no, no no no, you've got it all wrong, he's not

Dumbledore straightened and turned to Harry. He was wearing one of the most
astonished expressions Harry had ever seen on anyone, let alone someone with a
long silver beard. "Are you certain," said the old wizard after a moment, "that
he is ready to be redeemed? I fear that whatever goodness you think you see
within him is only wishful thinking - or worse, a lure, a bait -"

"Er, not likely," Harry said. "I mean if he's trying to disguise himself as a
good guy he's incredibly bad at it. This isn't a question of Draco coming up to
me and being all charming and me deciding that he must have a hidden core of
goodness deep down. I selected him for redemption specifically because he's the
heir to House Malfoy and if you had to pick one person to redeem, it would
obviously be him."

Dumbledore started laughing. Laughing a lot harder than Harry would expect,
almost howling. It seemed positively <em>undignified.</em> An ancient and
powerful wizard ought to chuckle in deep booming tones, not laugh so hard he was
gasping for breath. Harry had once literally fallen out of his chair while
watching the Marx Brothers movie <em>Duck Soup,</em> and that was how hard
Dumbledore was laughing now.

Dumbledore got himself under control again with a visible effort. "Ah, Harry,
one symptom of the disease called wisdom is that you begin laughing at things
that no one else thinks is funny, because when you're wise, Harry, you start
getting the jokes!" The old wizard wiped tears away from his eyes. "Ah, me. Ah,

"I'm afraid not," said Dumbledore, smiling again. "I was born seventy years
before that book was published, dear child. But it seems that my Muggleborn
students tend to think alike in certain ways. I have accumulated no fewer than
twenty copies of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> and three sets of Tolkien's
entire collected works, and I treasure every one of them." Dumbledore drew his
wand and held it up and struck a pose. "<em>You cannot pass!</em> How does that
look?"

"I see." Dumbledore sighed and glumly sheathed the wand in his belt. "I fear
there have been precious few Balrogs in my life of late. Nowadays it's all
meetings of the Wizengamot where I must try desperately to prevent any work from
getting done, and formal dinners where foreign politicians compete to see who
can be the most obstinate fool. And being mysterious at people, knowing things I
have no way of knowing, making cryptic statements which can only be understood
in hindsight, and all the other small ways in which powerful wizards amuse
themselves after they have left the part of the pattern that allows them to be
heroes. Speaking of which, Harry, I have a certain something to give you,
something which belonged to your father."

Dumbledore went back to his desk and sat down, pulling out one of the drawers as

Harry stared at it. It was light gray, discolored, irregularly shaped, sharp-

"It is not," said Dumbledore, shaking his head and looking very serious. "I took

Harry had the feeling this conversation was not going to work out in his favour,
but he carried on regardless. "No. I don't even know if that fallacy has an
official name, but if I had to make one up myself, it would be 'privileging the
hypothesis' or something like that. How can I put this formally... um... suppose
you had a million boxes, and only one of the boxes contained a diamond. And you
had a box full of diamond-detectors, and each diamond-detector always went off
in the presence of a diamond, and went off half the time on boxes that didn't
have a diamond. If you ran twenty detectors over all the boxes, you'd have, on
average, one false candidate and one true candidate left. And then it would just
take one or two more detectors before you were left with the one true candidate.
The point being that when there are lots of possible answers, <em>most</em> of
the evidence you need goes into just <em>locating</em> the true hypothesis out
of millions of possibilities - bringing it to your attention in the first place.
The amount of evidence you need to judge between two or three plausible
candidates is much smaller by comparison. So if you just jump ahead without
evidence and promote one particular possibility to the focus of your attention,
you're skipping over most of the work. Like, you live in a city where there are
a million people, and there's a murder, and a detective says, well, we've got no
evidence at all, so have we considered the possibility that Mortimer Snodgrass
did it?"

"No," said Harry. "But later it turns out that the murderer had black hair, and
Mortimer has black hair, so everyone's like, ah, looks like Mortimer did it
after all. So it's unfair to Mortimer for the police to <em>promote him to their
attention</em> without having good reasons already in hand to suspect him. When
there are lots of possibilities, most of the work goes into just
<em>locating</em> the true answer - starting to pay attention to it. You don't
need <em>proof</em>, or the sort of official evidence that scientists or courts
demand, but you need some sort of <em>hint</em>, and that hint has to
discriminate that particular possibility from the millions of others. Otherwise
you can't just pluck the right answer out of thin air. You can't even pluck a
possibility worth thinking about out of thin air. And there's got to be a
million other things I could do besides carrying around my father's rock. Just
because I'm ignorant about the universe doesn't mean that I'm unsure about how I
should reason in the presence of my uncertainty. The laws for thinking with
probabilities are no less iron than the laws that govern old-fashioned logic,
and what you just did is <em>not allowed.</em>" Harry paused. "<em>Unless</em>,
of course, you have some <em>hint</em> you're not mentioning."

"Ah," said Dumbledore. He tapped his cheek, looking thoughtful. "An interesting
argument, certainly, but doesn't it break down at the point where you make an
analogy between a million potential murderers only one of whom committed the
murder, and taking one out of many possible courses of action, when many
possible courses of action may all be wise? I do not say that carrying your
father's rock is the one best possible course of action, only that it is wiser
to do than not."

Dumbledore once again reached into the same desk drawer he had accessed earlier,
this time seeming to root around inside - at least his arm seemed to be moving.
"I will remark," Dumbledore said while Harry was still trying to sort out how to
reply to this completely unexpected rejoinder, "that it is a common
misconception of Ravenclaws that all the smart children are Sorted there,
leaving none for other Houses. This is not so; being Sorted to Ravenclaw
indicates that you are driven by your desire to know things, which is not at all
the same quality as being intelligent." The wizard was smiling as he bent over
the drawer. "Nonetheless, you <em>do</em> seem rather intelligent. Less like an
ordinary young hero and more like a young mysterious ancient wizard. I think I
may have been taking the wrong approach with you, Harry, and that you may be
able to understand things that few others could grasp. So I shall be daring, and
offer you a certain <em>other</em> heirloom."

"Excuse me," said Dumbledore, "I <em>am</em> still older and more mysterious
than you and if there are any revelations to be made then <em>I</em> will do the
revealing, thank you... oh, where <em>is</em> that thing!" Dumbledore reached
down further into the desk drawer, and still further. His head and shoulders and
whole torso disappeared inside until only his hips and legs were sticking out,
as though the desk drawer was eating him.

Dumbledore was looking rather saddened and weary, like he wanted to lean on a
wizard's staff he didn't have. "Really," said Dumbledore, "you try anything new
instead of following the same pattern every time for a hundred and ten years,
and people all start running away." The old wizard shook his head in sorrow.
"I'd hoped for better from you, Harry Potter. I'd heard that your own friends
also think you mad. I know they are mistaken. Will you not believe the same of
me?"

And a piece of himself which Harry didn't much like but couldn't quite manage to
silence was pondering the potential advantages of being one of the few friends
of this mad old wizard who also happened to be Headmaster, Chief Warlock, and
Supreme Mugwump. And unfortunately his inner Slytherin seemed to be much better
than Draco at turning people to the Dark Side, because it was saying things like
<em>poor fellow, he looks like he needs someone to talk to, doesn't he?</em> and
<em>you wouldn't want such a powerful man to end up trusting someone less
virtuous, would you?</em> and <em>I wonder what sort of incredible secrets
Dumbledore could tell you if, you know, you became friends with him</em> and
even <em>I bet he's got a reaallly interesting book collection.</em>

Dumbledore gazed at him, and then nodded with a slight grin. "I'm flattered by

fire, and move between all places as easily as fire may extinguish itself in one
place and be kindled in another. The tremendous strain of their innate magic
ages their bodies quickly, and yet they are as close to undying as any creature
that exists in this world, for whenever their bodies fail them they immolate
themselves in a burst of fire and leave behind a hatchling, or sometimes an
egg." Dumbledore came closer and inspected the chicken, frowning. "Hm... looking

"It is good that you asked me first," Professor McGonagall said, her face
growing a bit stern. "If you lost control of the Transfiguration the reversal
would cut off your finger and probably rip your hand in half. And at your age,
even a ring is too large a target for you to sustain indefinitely without it
being a serious drain on your magic. But I can have a ring forged for you with a
setting for a jewel, a <em>small</em> jewel, in contact with your skin, and you
can practice sustaining a safe subject, like a marshmallow. When you have kept

Professor McGonagall sighed. "That's a bit strange even for him." She stooped
and picked up the stack of parchments. "I'm sorry about this, Mr. Potter. I
apologise again for mistrusting you. But now it's my own turn to see the
Headmaster."
