    <em>Some</em> children would have waited until <em>after</em> their first trip
    to Diagon Alley.
388:
  text: |-
    "Bag of element 79," Harry said, and withdrew his hand, empty, from the mokeskin
    pouch.
389:
  text: |-
    Most children would have at least waited to get their <em>wands</em> first.
390:
  text: |-
    "Bag of <em>okane,</em>" said Harry. The heavy bag of gold popped up into his
    hand.
391:
  text: |-
    Harry withdrew the bag, then plunged it again into the mokeskin pouch. He took
    out his hand, put it back in, and said, "Bag of tokens of economic exchange."
    That time his hand came out empty.
392:
  text: |-
    "Give me back the bag that I just put in." Out came the bag of gold once more.
393:
  text: |-
    Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres had gotten his hands on at least one magical
    item. Why wait?
394:
  text: |-
    "Professor McGonagall," Harry said to the bemused witch strolling beside him,
    "can you give me two words, one word for gold, and one word for something else
    that isn't money, in a language that I wouldn't know? But don't tell me which is
    which."
395:
  text: |-
    "<em>Ahava</em> and <em>zahav,</em>" said Professor McGonagall. "That's Hebrew,
    and the other word means love."
396:
  text: |-
    "Thank you, Professor. Bag of <em>ahava.</em>" Empty.
397:
  text: |-
    "Bag of <em>zahav.</em>" And it popped up into his hand.
398:
  text: |-
    "Zahav is gold?" Harry questioned, and Professor McGonagall nodded.
399:
  text: |-
    Harry thought over his collected experimental data. It was only the most crude
    and preliminary sort of effort, but it was enough to support at least one
    conclusion:
400:
  text: |-
    "<em>Aaaaaaarrrgh this doesn't make any sense!</em> "
401:
  text: |-
    The witch beside him lifted a lofty eyebrow. "Problems, Mr. Potter?"
402:
  text: |-
    "I just falsified every single hypothesis I had! How can it know that 'bag of
    115 Galleons' is okay but not 'bag of 90 plus 25 Galleons'? It can
    <em>count</em> but it can't <em>add?</em> It can understand nouns, but not some
    noun phrases that mean the same thing? The person who made this probably didn't
    speak Japanese and <em>I</em> don't speak any Hebrew, so it's not using
    <em>their</em> knowledge, and it's not using <em>my</em> knowledge -" Harry
    waved a hand helplessly. "The rules seem <em>sorta</em> consistent but they
    don't <em>mean</em> anything! I'm not even going to ask how a <em>pouch</em>
    ends up with voice recognition and natural language understanding when the best
    Artificial Intelligence programmers can't get the fastest supercomputers to do
    it after thirty-five years of hard work," Harry gasped for breath, "but
    <em>what</em> is going <em>on?</em> "
403:
  text: |-
    "Magic," said Professor McGonagall.
404:
  text: |-
    "That's just a <em>word!</em> Even after you tell me that, I can't make any new
    predictions! It's exactly like saying 'phlogiston' or 'elan vital' or
    'emergence' or 'complexity'!"

    The black-robed witch laughed aloud. "But it <em>is</em> magic, Mr. Potter."
406:
  text: |-
    Harry slumped over a little. "With respect, Professor McGonagall, I'm not quite
    sure you understand what I'm trying to do here."
407:
  text: |-
    "With respect, Mr. Potter, I'm quite sure I don't. Unless - this is just a
    guess, mind - you're trying to take over the world?"
408:
  text: |-
    "No! I mean yes - well, <em>no!</em> "
409:
  text: |-
    "I think I should perhaps be alarmed that you have trouble answering the
    question."
410:
  text: |-
    Harry glumly considered the Dartmouth Conference on Artificial Intelligence in
    1956. It had been the first conference ever on the topic, the one that had
    coined the phrase "Artificial Intelligence". They had identified key problems
    such as making computers understand language, learn, and improve themselves.
    They had suggested, in perfect seriousness, that significant advances on these
    problems might be made by ten scientists working together for two months.
411:
  text: |-
    <em>No. Chin up. You're just</em> starting <em>on the problem of unravelling all
    the secrets of magic. You don't actually</em> know <em>whether it's going to be
    too difficult to do in two months.</em>
412:
  text: |-
    "And you <em>really</em> haven't heard of other wizards asking these sorts of
    questions or doing this sort of scientific experimenting?" Harry asked again. It
    just seemed so <em>obvious</em> to him.
413:
  text: |-
    Then again, it'd taken more than two hundred years <em>after</em> the invention
    of the scientific method before any Muggle scientists had thought to
    systematically investigate which sentences a <em>human four-year-old</em> could
    or couldn't understand. The developmental psychology of linguistics could've
    been discovered in the eighteenth century, in principle, but no one had even
    thought to look until the twentieth. So you couldn't really blame the much
    smaller wizarding world for not investigating the Retrieval Charm.
414:
  text: |-
    Professor McGonagall pursed her lips, then shrugged. "I'm still not sure what
    you mean by 'scientific experimenting', Mr. Potter. As I said, I've seen
    Muggleborn students try to get Muggle science to work inside Hogwarts, and
    people invent new Charms and Potions every year."
415:
  text: |-
    Harry shook his head. "Technology isn't the same thing as science at all. And
    trying lots of different ways to do something isn't the same as experimenting to
    figure out the rules." There were plenty of people who'd tried to invent flying
    machines by trying out lots of things-with-wings, but only the Wright Brothers
    had built a wind tunnel to measure lift... "Um, how many Muggle-raised children
    <em>do</em> you get at Hogwarts every year?"
416:
  text: |-
    "Perhaps ten or so?"
417:
  text: |-
    Harry missed a step and almost tripped over his own feet. "<em>Ten?</em> "
418:
  text: |-
    The Muggle world had a population of six billion and counting. If you were one
    in a million, there were seven of you in London and a thousand more in China. It
    was inevitable that the Muggle population would produce <em>some</em> eleven-
    year-olds who could do calculus - Harry knew he wasn't the only one. He'd met
    other prodigies in mathematical competitions. In fact he'd been thoroughly
    trounced by competitors who probably spent literally <em>all day</em> practising
    maths problems and who'd <em>never</em> read a science-fiction book and who
    would burn out <em>completely</em> before <em>puberty</em> and <em>never</em>
    amount to <em>anything</em> in their future lives because they'd just practised
    <em>known</em> techniques instead of learning to think <em>creatively</em>.
    (Harry was something of a sore loser.)
419:
  text: |-
    But... in the wizarding world...
420:
  text: |-
    Ten Muggle-raised children per year, who'd all ended their Muggle educations at
    the age of eleven? And Professor McGonagall might be biased, but she had claimed
    that Hogwarts was the largest and most eminent wizarding school in the world...
    and it only educated up to the age of seventeen.
421:
  text: |-
    Professor McGonagall undoubtedly knew every last detail of how you went about
    turning into a cat. But she seemed to have literally never <em>heard</em> of the
    scientific method. To her it was just Muggle magic. And she didn't even seem
    <em>curious</em> about what secrets might be hiding behind the natural language
    understanding of the Retrieval Charm.
422:
  text: |-
    That left two possibilities, really.
423:
  text: |-
    Possibility one: Magic was so incredibly opaque, convoluted, and impenetrable,
    that even though wizards and witches had tried their best to understand, they'd
    made little or no progress and eventually given up; and Harry would do no
    better.
424:
  text: |-
    <em>Or</em>...
425:
  text: |-
    Harry cracked his knuckles in determination, but they only made a quiet sort of
    clicking sound, rather than echoing ominously off the walls of Diagon Alley.
426:
  text: |-
    Possibility two: He'd be taking over the world.
427:
  text: |-
    Eventually. Perhaps not right away.
428:
  text: |-
    That sort of thing <em>did</em> sometimes take longer than two months. Muggle
    science hadn't gone to the moon in the first week after Galileo.
429:
  text: |-
    But Harry still couldn't stop the huge smile that was stretching his cheeks so
    wide they were starting to hurt.
430:
  text: |-
    Harry had always been frightened of ending up as one of those child prodigies
    that never amounted to anything and spent the rest of their lives boasting about
    how far ahead they'd been at age ten. But then most adult geniuses never
    amounted to anything either. There were probably a thousand people as
    intelligent as Einstein for every actual Einstein in history. Because those
    other geniuses hadn't gotten their hands on the one thing you absolutely needed
    to achieve greatness. They'd never found an important problem.
431:
  text: |-
    <em>You're mine now,</em> Harry thought at the walls of Diagon Alley, and all
    the shops and items, and all the shopkeepers and customers; and all the lands
    and people of wizarding Britain, and all the wider wizarding world; and the
    entire greater universe of which Muggle scientists understood so much less than
    they believed. <em>I, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, do now claim this
    territory in the name of Science.</em>
432:
  text: |-
    Lightning and thunder completely failed to flash and boom in the cloudless
    skies.
433:
  text: |-
    "What are you smiling about?" inquired Professor McGonagall, warily and wearily.
434:
  text: |-
    "I'm wondering if there's a spell to make lightning flash in the background
    whenever I make an ominous resolution," explained Harry. He was carefully
    memorising the exact words of his ominous resolution so that future history
    books would get it right.
435:
  text: |-
    "I have the distinct feeling that I ought to be doing something about this,"
    sighed Professor McGonagall.
436:
  text: |-
    "Ignore it, it'll go away. Ooh, shiny!" Harry put his thoughts of world conquest
    temporarily on hold and skipped over to a shop with an open display, and
    Professor McGonagall followed.
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
437:
  text: |-
    Harry had now bought his potions ingredients and cauldron, and, oh, a few more
    things. Items that seemed like good things to carry in Harry's Bag of Holding
    (aka Moke Super Pouch QX31 with Undetectable Extension Charm, Retrieval Charm,
    and Widening Lip). Smart, sensible purchases.
438:
  text: |-
    Harry genuinely didn't understand why Professor McGonagall was looking so
    <em>suspicious</em>.
439:
  text: |-
    Right now, Harry was in a shop expensive enough to display in the twisting main
    street of Diagon Alley. The shop had an open front with merchandise laid out on
    slanted wooden rows, guarded only by slight grey glows and a young-looking
    salesgirl in a much-shortened version of witch's robes that exposed her knees
    and elbows.
440:
  text: |-
    Harry was examining the wizarding equivalent of a first-aid kit, the Emergency
    Healing Pack Plus. There were two self-tightening tourniquets. A syringe of what
    looked like liquid fire, which was supposed to drastically slow circulation in a
    treated area while maintaining oxygenation of the blood for up to three minutes,
    if you needed to prevent a poison from spreading through the body. White cloth
    that could be wrapped over a part of the body to temporarily numb pain. Plus any
    number of other items that Harry totally failed to comprehend, like the
    "Dementor Exposure Treatment", which looked and smelled like ordinary chocolate.
    Or the "Bafflesnaffle Counter", which looked like a small quivering egg and
    carried a placard showing how to jam it up someone's nostril.
441:
  text: |-
    "A definite buy at five Galleons, wouldn't you agree?" Harry said to Professor
    McGonagall, and the teenage salesgirl hovering nearby nodded eagerly.
442:
  text: |-
    Harry had expected the Professor to make some sort of approving remark about his
    prudence and preparedness.
443:
  text: |-
    What he was getting instead could only be described as the Evil Eye.
444:
  text: |-
    "And just <em>why</em>," Professor McGonagall said with heavy scepticism, "do
    you expect to <em>need</em> a healer's kit, young man?" (After the unfortunate
    incident at the Potions shop, Professor McGonagall was trying to avoid saying
    "Mr. Potter" while anyone else was nearby.)
445:
  text: |-
    Harry's mouth opened and closed. "I don't <em>expect</em> to need it! It's just
    in case!"
446:
  text: |-
    "Just in case of <em>what?</em> "
447:
  text: |-
    Harry's eyes widened. "You think I'm <em>planning</em> to do something dangerous
    and <em>that's</em> why I want a medical kit?"
448:
  text: |-
    A look of grim suspicion and ironic disbelief was the answer.
449:
  text: |-
    "Great Scott!" said Harry. (This was an expression he'd learned from the mad
    scientist Doc Brown in <em>Back to the Future</em>.) "Were you also thinking
    that when I bought the Feather-Falling Potion, the Gillyweed, and the bottle of
    Food and Water Pills?"
450:
  text: |-
    "Yes."
451:
  text: |-
    Harry shook his head in amazement. "Just what sort of plan do you think I have
    <em>going</em>, here?"
452:
  text: |-
    "I don't know," Professor McGonagall said darkly, "but it ends either in you
    delivering a ton of silver to Gringotts, or in world domination."
453:
  text: |-
    "World domination is such an ugly phrase. I prefer to call it world
    optimisation."
454:
  text: |-
    This hilarious joke failed to reassure the witch giving him the Look of Doom.
455:
  text: |-
    "Wow," Harry said, as he realised that she was serious. "You really think that.
    You really think I'm planning to do something dangerous."
456:
  text: |-
    "Yes."
457:
  text: |-
    "Like that's the <em>only</em> reason anyone would ever buy a first-aid kit?
    Don't take this the wrong way, Professor McGonagall, but <em>what sort of crazy
    children are you used to dealing with</em>?"
458:
  text: |-
    "Gryffindors," spat Professor McGonagall, the word carrying a freight of
    bitterness and despair that fell like an eternal curse on all youthful
    enthusiasm and high spirits.
459:
  text: |-
    "Deputy Headmistress Professor Minerva McGonagall," Harry said, putting his
    hands sternly on his hips. "I am not going to be in Gryffindor -"
460:
  text: |-
    At this point the Deputy Headmistress interjected something about how if he
    <em>was</em> she would figure out how to kill a hat, which odd remark Harry let
    pass without comment, though the salesgirl seemed to be having a sudden coughing
    fit.
461:
  text: |-
    "- I am going to be in Ravenclaw. And if you really think that I'm planning to
    do something dangerous, then, honestly, you don't understand me <em>at all.</em>
    I don't <em>like</em> danger, it is <em>scary.</em> I am being <em>prudent</em>.
    I am being <em>cautious</em>. I am preparing for <em>unforeseen
    contingencies</em>. Like my parents used to sing to me: <em>Be prepared! That's
    the Boy Scout's marching song! Be prepared! As through life you march along!
    Don't be nervous, don't be flustered, don't be scared - be prepared!</em> "

    (Harry's parents had in fact only ever sung him those <em>particular</em> lines
    of that Tom Lehrer song, and Harry was blissfully unaware of the rest.)
463:
  text: |-
    Professor McGonagall's stance had slightly softened - though mostly when Harry
    had said that he was heading for Ravenclaw. "What sort of <em>contingency</em>
    do you imagine this kit might prepare you for, <em>young man?</em> "
464:
  text: |-
    "One of my classmates gets bitten by a horrible monster, and as I scrabble
    frantically in my mokeskin pouch for something that could help her, she looks at
    me sadly and with her last breath says, <em>'Why weren't you prepared?'</em> And
    then she dies, and I know as her eyes close that she won't ever forgive me -"

    Harry heard the salesgirl gasp, and he looked up to see her staring at him with
    her lips pressed tight. Then the young woman whirled and fled into the deeper
    recesses of the shop.
466:
  text: |-
    <em>What...?</em>
467:
  text: |-
    Professor McGonagall reached down, and took Harry's hand in hers, gently but
    firmly, and pulled Harry out of the main street of Diagon Alley, leading him
    into an alleyway between two shops which was paved in dirty bricks and dead-
    ended in a wall of solid black dirt.
468:
  text: |-
    The tall witch pointed her wand at the main street and spoke, <em>"Quietus</em>"
    she said, and a screen of silence descended around them, blocking out all the
    street noises.
469:
  text: |-
    <em>What did I do wrong...</em>
470:
  text: |-
    Professor McGonagall turned to regard Harry. She didn't have a full adult
    Wrongdoing Face, but her expression was flat, controlled. "You must remember,
    Mr. Potter," she said, "that there was a war in this country not ten years ago.
    Everyone has lost someone, and to speak of friends dying in your arms - is not
    done lightly."
471:
  text: |-
    "I - I didn't mean to -" The inference dropped like a falling stone into Harry's
    exceptionally vivid imagination. He'd talked about someone breathing their last
    breath - and then the salesgirl had run away - and the war had ended ten years
    ago so that girl would have been at most eight or nine years old, when, when,
    "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to..." Harry choked up, and turned away to run from
    the older witch's gaze but there was a wall of dirt blocking his way and he
    didn't have his wand yet. "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm <em>sorry!</em> "
472:
  text: |-
    There came a heavy sigh from behind him. "I know you are, Mr. Potter."
473:
  text: |-
    Harry dared to peek behind him. Professor McGonagall only seemed sad, now. "I'm
    sorry," Harry said again, feeling wretched. "Did anything like that happen to -"
    and then Harry shut his lips and slapped a hand over his mouth for good measure.
474:
  text: |-
    The older witch's face grew a little sadder. "You must learn to think before you
    speak, Mr. Potter, or else go through life without many friends. That has been
    the fate of many a Ravenclaw, and I hope it will not be yours."
475:
  text: |-
    Harry wanted to just run away. He wanted to pull out a wand and erase the whole
    thing from Professor McGonagall's memory, be back with her outside the shop
    again, <em>make it didn't happen -</em>
476:
  text: |-
    "But to answer your question, Mr. Potter, no, nothing like <em>that</em> has
    ever happened to me. Certainly I've watched a friend breathe their last, once or
    seven times. But not one of them ever cursed me as they died, and I never
    thought that they wouldn't forgive me. Why would you <em>say</em> such a thing,
    Mr. Potter? Why would you even <em>think</em> it?"
477:
  text: |-
    "I, I, I," Harry swallowed. "It's just that I always try to imagine the worst
    thing that could happen," and maybe he'd also been joking around a little but he
    would rather have bitten off his own tongue than say that now.
478:
  text: |-
    "What?" said Professor McGonagall. "But <em>why?"</em>
479:
  text: |-
    "So I can stop it from happening!"
480:
  text: |-
    "Mr. Potter..." the older witch's voice trailed off. Then she sighed, and knelt
    down beside him. "Mr. Potter," she said, gently now, "it's not your
    responsibility to take care of the students at Hogwarts. It's mine. I won't let
    anything bad happen to you or anyone else. Hogwarts is the safest place for
    magical children in all the wizarding world, and Madam Pomfrey has a full
    healer's office. You won't need a healer's kit at all, let alone a five-Galleon
    one."
481:
  text: |-
    "But I <em>do!</em> " Harry burst out. "<em>Nowhere</em> is perfectly safe! And
    what if my parents have a heart attack or get in an accident when I go home for
    Christmas - Madam Pomfrey won't be there, I'll need a healer's kit of my own -"
482:
  text: |-
    "<em>What</em> in Merlin's name..." Professor McGonagall said. She stood up, and
    looked down at Harry an expression torn between annoyance and concern. "There's
    no need to think about such terrible things, Mr. Potter!"
483:
  text: |-
    Harry's expression twisted up into bitterness, hearing that. "Yes there
    <em>is!</em> If you don't think, you don't just get hurt yourself, you end up
    hurting other people!"
484:
  text: |-
    Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, then closed it. The witch rubbed the
    bridge of her nose, looking thoughtful. "Mr. Potter... if I were to offer to
    listen to you for a while... is there anything you'd like to talk to me about?"
485:
  text: |-
    "About what?"
486:
  text: |-
    "About why you're convinced you must always be on your guard against terrible
    things happening to you."
487:
  text: |-
    Harry stared at her in puzzlement. That was a self-evident axiom. "Well..."
    Harry said slowly. He tried to organise his thoughts. How <em>could</em> he
    explain himself to a Professor-witch, when she didn't even know the basics?
    "Muggle researchers have found that people are always very optimistic, compared
    to reality. Like they say something will take two days and it takes ten days, or
    they say it'll take two months and it takes over thirty-five years. For example,
    in one experiment, they asked students for times by which they were 50% sure,
    75% sure, and 99% sure they'd complete their homework, and only 13%, 19%, and
    45% of the students finished by those times. And they found that the reason was
    that when they asked one group for their best-case estimates if everything went
    as well as possible, and another group for their average-case estimates if
    everything went as usual, they got back answers that were statistically
    indistinguishable. See, if you ask someone what they expect in the
    <em>normal</em> case, they visualise what looks like the line of maximum
    probability at each step along the way - everything going according to plan,
    with no surprises. But actually, since more than half the students didn't finish
    by the time they were 99% sure they'd be done, reality usually delivers results
    a little worse than the 'worst-case scenario'. It's called the planning fallacy,
    and the best way to fix it is to ask how long things took the last time you
    tried them. That's called using the outside view instead of the inside view. But
    when you're doing something new and can't do that, you just have to be really,
    really, really pessimistic. Like, so pessimistic that reality actually comes out
    <em>better</em> than you expected around as often and as much as it comes out
    worse. It's actually <em>really hard</em> to be <em>so</em> pessimistic that you
    stand a decent chance of <em>undershooting</em> real life. Like I make this big
    effort to be gloomy and I imagine one of my classmates getting bitten, but what
    actually happens is that the surviving Death Eaters attack the whole school to
    get at me. But on a happier note -"

  text: |-
    "Stop," said Professor McGonagall.
489:
  text: |-
    Harry stopped. He had just been about to point out that at least they knew the
    Dark Lord wouldn't attack, since he was dead.
490:
  text: |-
    "I think I might not have made myself clear," the witch said, her precise
    Scottish voice sounding even more careful. "Did anything happen to <em>you
    personally</em> that frightened you, Mr. Potter?"
491:
  text: |-
    "What happened to me personally is only anecdotal evidence," Harry explained.
    "It doesn't carry the same weight as a replicated, peer-reviewed journal article
    about a controlled study with random assignment, many subjects, large effect
    sizes and strong statistical significance."
492:
  text: |-
    Professor McGonagall pinched the bridge of her nose, inhaled, and exhaled. "I
    would still like to hear about it," she said.
493:
  text: |-
    "Um..." Harry said. He took a deep breath. "There'd been some muggings in our
    neighborhood, and my mother asked me to return a pan she'd borrowed to a
    neighbor two streets away, and I said I didn't want to because I might get
    mugged, and she said, 'Harry, don't say things like that!' Like thinking about
    it would <em>make</em> it happen, so if I didn't talk about it, I would be safe.
    I tried to explain why I wasn't reassured, and she made me carry over the pan
    anyway. I was too young to know how statistically unlikely it was for a mugger
    to target me, but I was old enough to know that not-thinking about something
    doesn't stop it from happening, so I was really scared."
494:
  text: |-
    "Nothing else?" Professor McGonagall said after a pause, when it became clear
    that Harry was done. "There isn't anything <em>else</em> that happened to you?"
495:
  text: |-
    "I know it doesn't <em>sound</em> like much," Harry defended. "But it was just
    one of those critical life moments, you see? I mean, I <em>knew</em> that not
    thinking about something doesn't stop it from happening, I <em>knew</em> that,
    but I could see that Mum really thought that way." Harry stopped, struggling
    with the anger that was starting to rise up again when he thought about it. "She
    <em>wouldn't listen</em>. I tried to tell her, I <em>begged</em> her not to send
    me out, and she <em>laughed it off</em>. Everything I said, she treated like
    some sort of big joke..." Harry forced the black rage back down again. "That's
    when I realised that everyone who was supposed to protect me was actually crazy,
    and that they wouldn't listen to me no matter how much I begged them, and that I
    couldn't ever rely on them to get anything right." Sometimes good intentions
    weren't enough, sometimes you had to be sane...
496:
  text: |-
    There was a long silence.
497:
  text: |-
    Harry took the time to breathe deeply and calm himself down. There was no point
    in getting angry. There was no point in getting angry. <em>All</em> parents were
    like that, <em>no</em> adult would lower themselves far enough to place
    themselves on level ground with a child and listen, his genetic parents would
    have been no different. Sanity was a tiny spark in the night, an infinitesimally
    rare exception to the rule of madness, so there was no point in getting angry.
498:
  text: |-
    Harry didn't like himself when he was angry.
499:
  text: |-
    "Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Potter," said Professor McGonagall after a
    while. There was an abstracted look on her face (almost exactly the same look
    that had appeared on Harry's own face while experimenting on the pouch, if Harry
    had only seen himself in a mirror to realise that). "I shall have to think about
    this." She turned towards the alley mouthway, and raised her wand -
500:
  text: |-
    "Um," Harry said, "can we go get the healer's kit now?"
501:
  text: |-
    The witch paused, and looked back at him steadily. "And if I say no - that it is
    too expensive and you won't need it - then what?"
502:
  text: |-
    Harry's face twisted in bitterness. "Exactly what you're thinking, Professor
    McGonagall. <em>Exactly</em> what you're thinking. I conclude you're another
    crazy adult I can't talk to, and I start planning how to get my hands on a
    healer's kit anyway."
503:
  text: |-
    "I am your guardian on this trip," Professor McGonagall said with a tinge of
    danger. "I <em>will not</em> allow you to push me around."
504:
  text: |-
    "I understand," Harry said. He kept the resentment out of his voice, and didn't
    say any of the other things that came to mind. Professor McGonagall had told him
    to think before he spoke. He probably wouldn't remember that tomorrow, but he
    could at least remember it for five minutes.
505:
  text: |-
    The witch's wand made a slight circle in her hand, and the noises of Diagon
    Alley came back. "All right, young man," she said. "Let's go get that healer's
    kit."
506:
  text: |-
    Harry's jaw dropped in surprise. Then he hurried after her, almost stumbling in
    his sudden rush.
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
507:
  text: |-
    The shop was the same as they had left it, recognisable and unrecognisable items
    still laid out on the slanted wooden display, the grey glow still protecting and
    the salesgirl back in her old position. The salesgirl looked up as they
    approached, her face showing surprise.
508:
  text: |-
    "I'm sorry," she said as they got closer, and Harry spoke at almost the same
    moment, "I apologise for -"
509:
  text: |-
    They broke off and looked at each other, and then the salesgirl laughed a
    little. "I didn't mean to get you in trouble with Professor McGonagall," she
    said. Her voice lowered conspiratorially. "I hope she wasn't <em>too</em> awful
    to you."
510:
  text: |-
    "<em>Della!</em> " said Professor McGonagall, sounding scandalised.
511:
  text: |-
    "Bag of gold," Harry said to his pouch, and then looked back up at the salesgirl
    while he counted out five Galleons. "Don't worry, I understand that she's only
    awful to me because she loves me."
512:
  text: |-
    He counted out five Galleons to the salesgirl while Professor McGonagall was
    spluttering something unimportant. "One Emergency Healing Pack Plus, please."
513:
  text: |-
    It was actually sort of unnerving to see how the Widening Lip swallowed the
    briefcase-sized medical kit. Harry couldn't help wondering what would happen if
    he tried climbing into the mokeskin pouch himself, given that only the person
    who put something in was supposed to be able to take it out again.
514:
  text: |-
    When the pouch was done... eating... his hard-won purchase, Harry swore he heard
    a small burping sound afterward. That <em>had</em> to have been spelled in on
    purpose. The alternative hypothesis was too horrifying to contemplate... in fact
    Harry couldn't even <em>think</em> of any alternative hypotheses. Harry looked
    back up at the Professor, as they began walking through Diagon Alley once more.
    "Where to next?"
515:
  text: |-
    Professor McGonagall pointed toward a shop that looked as if it had been made
    from flesh instead of bricks and covered in fur instead of paint. "Small pets
    are permitted at Hogwarts - you could get an owl to send letters, for example -"
516:
  text: |-
    "Can I pay a Knut or something and <em>rent</em> an owl when I need to send
    mail?"
517:
  text: |-
    "Yes," said Professor McGonagall.
518:
  text: |-
    "Then I think emphatically <em>no.</em>"
519:
  text: |-
    Professor McGonagall nodded, as though ticking off a point. "Might I ask why
    not?"
520:
  text: |-
    "I had a pet rock once. It died."

    "You don't think you could take care of a pet?"
522:
  text: |-
    "I <em>could,</em>" Harry said, "but I would end up obsessing all day long about
    whether I'd remembered to feed it that day or if it was slowly starving in its
    cage, wondering where its master was and why there wasn't any food."
523:
  text: |-
    "That poor owl," the older witch said in a soft voice. "Abandoned like that. I
    wonder what it would do."
524:
  text: |-
    "Well, I expect it'd get really hungry and start trying to claw its way out of
    the cage or the box or whatever, though it probably wouldn't have much luck with
    that -" Harry stopped short.
525:
  text: |-
    The witch went on, still in that soft voice. "And what would happen to it
    afterward?"
526:
  text: |-
    "Excuse me," Harry said, and he reached up to take Professor McGonagall by the
    hand, gently but firmly, and steered her into yet another alleyway; after
    ducking so many well-wishers the process had become almost unnoticeably routine.
    "Please cast that silencing spell."
527:
  text: |-
    "<em>Quietus.</em>"
528:
  text: |-
    Harry's voice was shaking. "That owl does <em>not</em> represent me, my parents
    <em>never</em> locked me in a cupboard and left me to starve, I do <em>not</em>
    have abandonment fears and I <em>don't like the trend of your thoughts,
    Professor McGonagall!</em> "
529:
  text: |-
    The witch looked down at him gravely. "And what thoughts would those be, Mr.
    Potter?"
530:
  text: |-
    "You think I was," Harry was having trouble saying it, "I was <em>abused?</em> "
531:
  text: |-
    "Were you?"
532:
  text: |-
    "<em>No!</em> " Harry shouted. "No, I never was! Do you think I'm
    <em>stupid?</em> I <em>know</em> about the concept of child abuse, I
    <em>know</em> about inappropriate touching and all of that and if anything like
    that happened I would call the police! And report it to the head teacher! And
    look up social services in the phone book! And tell Grandpa and Grandma and Mrs.
    Figg! But my parents <em>never</em> did anything like that, never ever
    <em>ever!</em> How <em>dare</em> you suggest such a thing!"
533:
  text: |-
    The older witch gazed at him steadily. "It is my duty as Deputy Headmistress to
    investigate possible signs of abuse in the children under my care."
534:
  text: |-
    Harry's anger was spiralling out of control into pure, black fury. "Don't you
    ever <em>dare</em> breathe a word of these, these <em>insinuations</em> to
    anyone else! <em>No one</em>, do you hear me, McGonagall? An accusation like
    that can ruin people and destroy families even when the parents are completely
    innocent! I've read about it in the newspapers!" Harry's voice was climbing to a
    high-pitched scream. "The <em>system</em> doesn't know how to <em>stop</em>, it
    doesn't believe the parents <em>or</em> the children when they say nothing
    happened! <em>Don't you dare threaten my family with that! I won't let you
    destroy my home!</em> "
535:
  text: |-
    "Harry," the older witch said softly, and she reached out a hand towards him -
536:
  text: |-
    Harry took a fast step back, and his hand snapped up and knocked hers away.
537:
  text: |-
    McGonagall froze, then she pulled her hand back, and took a step backwards.
    "Harry, it's all right," she said. "I believe you."
538:
  text: |-
    "<em>Do you,</em>" Harry hissed. The fury still roaring through his blood. "Or
    are you just waiting to get away from me so you can file the papers?"
539:
  text: |-
    "Harry, I saw your house. I saw you with your parents. They love you. You love
    them. I do believe you when you say that your parents are not abusing you. But I
    <em>had</em> to ask, because there is something strange at work here."
540:
  text: |-
    Harry stared at her coldly. "Like what?"
541:
  text: |-
    "Harry, I've seen many abused children in my time at Hogwarts, it would break
    your heart to know how many. And, when you're happy, you don't behave like one
    of those children, not at <em>all</em>. You smile at strangers, you hug people,
    I put my hand on your shoulder and you didn't flinch. But sometimes, only
    sometimes, you say or do something that seems <em>very</em> much like... someone
    who spent his first eleven years locked in a cellar. Not the loving family that
    I saw." Professor McGonagall tilted her head, her expression growing puzzled
    again.
542:
  text: |-
    Harry took this in, processing it. The black rage began to drain away, as it
    dawned on him that he was being listened to respectfully, and that his family
    wasn't in danger.
543:
  text: |-
    "And how <em>do</em> you explain your observations, Professor McGonagall?"
544:
  text: |-
    "I don't know," she said. "But it's possible that something could have happened
    to you that you don't remember."
545:
  text: |-
    Fury rose up again in Harry. That sounded all too much like what he'd read in
    the newspaper stories of shattered families. "Suppressed memory is a load of
    <em>pseudoscience!</em> People do <em>not</em> repress traumatic memories, they
    remember them all <em>too</em> well for the rest of their lives!"
546:
  text: |-
    "No, Mr. Potter. There is a Charm called Obliviation."
547:
  text: |-
    Harry froze in place. "A spell that erases memories?"
548:
  text: |-
    The older witch nodded. "But not all the effects of the experience, if you see
    what I'm saying, Mr. Potter."
549:
  text: |-
    A chill went down Harry's spine. <em>That</em> hypothesis... could <em>not</em>
    be easily refuted. "But my parents couldn't do that!"
550:
  text: |-
    "Indeed not," said Professor McGonagall. "It would have taken someone from the
    wizarding world. There's... no way to be certain, I'm afraid."
551:
  text: |-
    Harry's rationalist skills began to boot up again. "Professor McGonagall, how
    sure are you of your observations, and what alternative explanations could there
    also be?"
552:
  text: |-
    The witch opened her hands, as though to show their emptiness. "Sure? I'm sure
    of <em>nothing</em>, Mr. Potter. In all my life I've never met anyone else like
    you. Sometimes you just don't seem eleven years old or even all that
    <em>human</em>."

        You mean the part where Professor McGonagall says "Sure? I'm sure of nothing,

    Harry's eyebrows rose toward the sky -
554:

    "I'm sorry!" Professor McGonagall said quickly. "I'm very sorry, Mr. Potter. I
    was trying to make a point and I'm afraid that came out sounding different from
    what I had in mind -"
555:
  text: |-
    "On the contrary, Professor McGonagall," Harry said, and slowly smiled. "I shall
    take it as a very great compliment. But would you mind if I offered an
    alternative explanation?"
556:

    "Please do."

    "Children aren't meant to be too much smarter than their parents," Harry said.
    "Or too much saner, maybe - my father could probably outsmart me if he was, you
    know, actually <em>trying,</em> instead of using his adult intelligence mainly
    to come up with new reasons not to change his mind -" Harry stopped. "I'm too
    smart, Professor. I've got nothing to say to normal children. Adults don't
    respect me enough to really talk to me. And frankly, even if they did, they
    wouldn't sound as smart as Richard Feynman, so I might as well read something
    Richard Feynman wrote instead. I'm <em>isolated</em>, Professor McGonagall. I've
    been isolated my whole life. Maybe that has some of the same effects as being
    locked in a cellar. And I'm too intelligent to look up to my parents the way
    that children are designed to do. My parents love me, but they don't feel
    obliged to respond to reason, and sometimes I feel like they're the children -
    children who <em>won't listen</em> and have absolute authority over my whole
    existence. I try not to be too bitter about it, but I also try to be
    <em>honest</em> with myself, so, yes, I'm bitter. And I also have an anger
    management problem, but I'm working on it. That's all."
558:
  text: |-
    "<em>That's all?</em> "
559:

    Harry nodded firmly. "That's all. Surely, Professor McGonagall, even in magical
    Britain, the normal explanation is always worth <em>considering?</em> "

    It was later in the day, the sun lowering in the summer sky and shoppers
    beginning to peter out from the streets. Some shops had already closed; Harry
    and Professor McGonagall had bought his textbooks from Flourish and Blotts just
    under the deadline. With only a slight explosion when Harry had made a beeline
    for the keyword "Arithmancy" and discovered that the seventh-year textbooks
    invoked nothing more mathematically advanced than trigonometry.
561:
  text: |-
    At this moment, though, dreams of low-hanging research fruit were far from
    Harry's mind.
562:
  text: |-
    At this moment, the two of them were walking out of Ollivander's, and Harry was
    staring at his wand. He'd waved it, and produced multicoloured sparks, which
    really shouldn't have come as such an extra shock after everything else he'd
    seen, but somehow -
563:
  text: |-
    <em>I can do magic.</em>
564:
  text: |-
    <em>Me. As in, me personally. I am magical; I am a wizard.</em>
565:
  text: |-
    He had <em>felt</em> the magic pouring up his arm, and in that instant, realised
    that he had always had that sense, that he had possessed it his whole life, the
    sense that was not sight or sound or smell or taste or touch but only magic.
    Like having eyes but keeping them always closed, so that you didn't even realise
    that you were seeing darkness; and then one day the eye opened, and saw the
    world. The shock of it had poured through him, touching pieces of himself,
    awakening them, and then died away in seconds; leaving only the certain
    knowledge that he was now a wizard, and always had been, and had even, in some
    strange way, always known it.
566:
  text: |-
    And -
567:
  text: |-
    <em>"It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when
    its brother why, its brother gave you that scar."</em>
568:
  text: |-
    That could not <em>possibly</em> be coincidence. There had been
    <em>thousands</em> of wands in that shop. Well, okay, actually it <em>could</em>
    be coincidence, there were six billion people in the world and thousand-to-one
    coincidences happened every day. But Bayes's Theorem said that any reasonable
    hypothesis which made it <em>more</em> likely than a thousand-to-one that he'd
    end up with the brother to the Dark Lord's wand, was going to have an advantage.
569:
  text: |-
    Professor McGonagall had simply said <em>how peculiar</em> and left it at that,
    which had put Harry into a state of shock at the sheer, overwhelming
    <em>uncuriosity</em> of wizards and witches. In no <em>imaginable</em> world
    would Harry have just went "Hm" and walked out of the shop without even
    <em>trying</em> to come up with a hypothesis for what was going on.
570:
  text: |-
    His left hand rose and touched his scar.
571:
  text: |-
    What... <em>exactly...</em>
572:
  text: |-
    "You're a full wizard now," said Professor McGonagall. "Congratulations."
573:
  text: |-
    Harry nodded.
574:
  text: |-
    "And what do you think of the wizarding world?" said she.
575:
  text: |-
    "It's strange," Harry said. "I ought to be thinking about everything I've seen
    of magic... everything that I now know is possible, and everything I now know to
    be a lie, and all the work left before me to understand it. And yet I find
    myself distracted by relative trivialities like," Harry lowered his voice, "the
    whole Boy-Who-Lived thing." There didn't seem to be anyone nearby, but no point
    tempting fate.
576:
  text: |-
    Professor McGonagall <em>ahemmed</em>. "Really? You don't say."
577:
  text: |-
    Harry nodded. "Yes. It's just... <em>odd.</em> To find out that you were part of
    this grand story, the quest to defeat the great and terrible Dark Lord, and it's
    already <em>done.</em> Finished. Completely over with. Like you're Frodo Baggins
    and you find out that your parents took you to Mount Doom and had you toss in
    the Ring when you were one year old and you don't even remember it."
578:
  text: |-
    Professor McGonagall's smile had grown somewhat fixed.
579:
  text: |-
    "You know, if I were anyone else, anyone else at all, I'd probably be pretty
    worried about living up to that start. <em>Gosh, Harry, what have you done since
    you defeated the Dark Lord? Your own bookshop? That's great! Say, did you know I
    named my child after you?</em> But I have hopes that this will not prove to be a
    problem." Harry sighed. "Still... it's almost enough to make me wish that there
    were <em>some</em> loose ends from the quest, just so I could say that I really,
    you know, <em>participated</em> somehow."
580:
  text: |-
    "Oh?" said Professor McGonagall in an odd tone. "What did you have in mind?"
581:
  text: |-
    "Well, for example, you mentioned that my parents were betrayed. Who betrayed
    them?"
582:
  text: |-
    "Sirius Black," the witch said, almost hissing the name. "He's in Azkaban.
    Wizarding prison."
583:
  text: |-
    "How probable is it that Sirius Black will break out of prison and I'll have to
    track him down and defeat him in some sort of spectacular duel, or better yet
    put a large bounty on his head and hide out in Australia while I wait for the
    results?"
584:
  text: |-
    Professor McGonagall blinked. Twice. "Not likely. No one has ever escaped from
    Azkaban, and I doubt that <em>he</em> will be the first."
585:
  text: |-
    Harry was a bit sceptical of that "<em>no one</em> has <em>ever</em> escaped
    from Azkaban" line. Still, maybe with magic you could actually get close to a
    100% perfect prison, especially if you had a wand and they did not. The best way
    to get out would be to not go there in the first place.
586:
  text: |-
    "All right then," Harry said. "Sounds like it's been nicely wrapped up." He
    sighed, scrubbing his palm over his head. "Or maybe the Dark Lord didn't
    <em>really</em> die that night. Not completely. His spirit lingers, whispering
    to people in nightmares that bleed over into the waking world, searching for a
    way back into the living lands he swore to destroy, and now, in accordance with
    the ancient prophecy, he and I are locked in a deadly duel where the winner
    shall lose and the loser shall win -"
587:
  text: |-
    Professor McGonagall's head swivelled, and her eyes darted around, as though to
    search the street for listeners.
588:

    "I'm <em>joking</em>, Professor," Harry said with some annoyance. Sheesh, why
    did she always take everything so seriously -
589:
  text: |-
    A slow sinking sensation began to dawn in the pit of Harry's stomach.
590:
  text: |-
    Professor McGonagall looked at Harry with a calm expression. A very,
    <em>very</em> calm expression. Then a smile was put on. "Of course you are, Mr.
    Potter."
591:
  text: |-
    <em>Aw crap.</em>
592:
  text: |-
    If Harry had needed to formalise the wordless inference that had just flashed
    into his mind, it would have come out something like, 'If I estimate the
    probability of Professor McGonagall doing what I just saw as the result of
    carefully controlling herself, versus the probability distribution for all the
    things she would do <em>naturally</em> if I made a bad joke, then this behavior
    is significant evidence for her hiding something.'
593:
  text: |-
    But what Harry actually thought was, <em>Aw crap.</em>
594:
  text: |-
    Harry turned his own head to scan the street. Nope, no one nearby. "He's
    <em>not</em> dead, is he," Harry sighed.
595:
  text: |-
    "Mr. Potter -"
596:
  text: |-
    "The Dark Lord is alive. Of <em>course</em> he's alive. It was an <em>act</em>
    of utter <em>optimism</em> for me to have even <em>dreamed</em> otherwise. I
    <em>must</em> have taken leave of my <em>senses</em>, I can't <em>imagine</em>
    what I was <em>thinking.</em> Just because <em>someone</em> said that his body
    was found burned to a <em>crisp</em>, I can't imagine why I would have thought
    he was <em>dead.</em> <em>Clearly</em> I have much left to learn about the art
    of proper <em>pessimism.</em>"
597:
  text: |-
    "Mr. Potter -"
598:
  text: |-
    "At least tell me there's not really a prophecy..." Professor McGonagall was
    still giving him that bright, fixed smile. "Oh, you have <em>got</em> to be
    kidding me."
599:
  text: |-
    "Mr. Potter, you shouldn't go inventing things to worry about -"
600:
  text: |-
    "Are you <em>actually</em> going to tell me <em>that?</em> Imagine my reaction
    later, when I find out that there was something to worry about after all."
601:
  text: |-
    Her fixed smile faltered.
602:
  text: |-
    Harry's shoulders slumped. "I have a whole world of magic to analyse. I do
    <em>not</em> have time for this."
603:
  text: |-
    Then both of them shut up, as a man in flowing orange robes appeared on the
    street and slowly passed them by; Professor McGonagall's eyes tracked him,
    unobtrusively. Harry's mouth was moving as he chewed hard on his lip, and
    someone watching closely would have noticed a tiny spot of blood appear.
604:
  text: |-
    When the orange-robed man had passed into the distance, Harry spoke again, in a
    low murmur. "Are you going to tell me the truth now, Professor McGonagall? And
    don't bother trying to wave it off, I'm not stupid."
605:
  text: |-
    "You're <em>eleven years old</em>, Mr. Potter!" she said in a harsh whisper.
606:
  text: |-
    "And therefore subhuman. Sorry... for a moment there, I <em>forgot</em>."
607:
  text: |-
    "These are dreadful and important matters! They are <em>secret,</em> Mr. Potter!
    It is a <em>catastrophe</em> that you, still a child, know even this much! You
    must not tell <em>anyone,</em> do you understand? Absolutely no one!"
608:
  text: |-
    As sometimes happened when Harry got <em>sufficiently</em> angry, his blood went
    cold, instead of hot, and a terrible dark clarity descended over his mind,
    mapping out possible tactics and assessing their consequences with iron realism.
609:
  text: |-
    <em>Point out that you have a right to know: Failure. Eleven-year-old children
    do not have rights to know anything, in McGonagall's eyes.</em>
610:
  text: |-
    <em>Say that you will not be friends any more: Failure. She does not value your
    friendship sufficiently.</em>
611:
  text: |-
    <em>Point out that you will be in danger if you do not know: Failure. Plans have
    already been made based on your ignorance. The</em> certain <em>inconvenience of
    rethinking will seem far more unpalatable than the mere</em> uncertain
    <em>prospect of your coming to harm.</em>
612:
  text: |-
    <em>Justice and reason will both fail. You must either find something you have
    that she wants, or find something you can do which she fears...</em>
613:
  text: |-
    Ah.
614:
  text: |-
    "Well then, Professor," Harry said in a low, icy tone, "it sounds like I have
    something you want. You can, if you like, tell me the truth, the <em>whole</em>
    truth, and in return I will keep your secrets. Or you can try to keep me
    ignorant so you can use me as a pawn, in which case I will owe you nothing."
615:
  text: |-
    McGonagall stopped short in the street. Her eyes blazed and her voice descended
    into an outright hiss. "How dare you!"
616:
  text: |-
    "<em>How dare you!</em> " he whispered back at her.
617:
  text: |-
    "You would <em>blackmail</em> me?"
618:
  text: |-
    Harry's lips twisted. "I am <em>offering</em> you a <em>favor.</em> I am
    <em>giving</em> you a chance to protect <em>your</em> precious secret. If you
    refuse I will have <em>every</em> natural motive to make inquiries elsewhere,
    not to spite you, but because I <em>have to know!</em> Get past your pointless
    anger at a <em>child</em> who you think ought to obey you, and you'll realise
    that any sane adult would do the same! <em>Look at it from my perspective! How
    would you feel if it was YOU?</em> "
619:
  text: |-
    Harry watched McGonagall, observed her harsh breathing. It occurred to him that
    it was time to ease off the pressure, let her simmer for a while. "You don't
    have to decide right away," Harry said in a more normal tone. "I'll understand
    if you want time to think about my <em>offer</em>... but I'll warn you of one
    thing," Harry said, his voice going colder. "Don't try that Obliviation spell on
    me. Some time ago I worked out a signal, and I have already sent that signal to
    myself. If I find that signal and I don't <em>remember</em> sending it..." Harry
    let his voice trail off significantly.
620:
  text: |-
    McGonagall's face was working as her expressions shifted. "I... wasn't thinking
    of Obliviating you, Mr. Potter... but why would you have <em>invented</em> such
    a signal if you didn't know about -"
621:
  text: |-
    "I thought of it while reading a Muggle science-fiction book, and said to
    myself, <em>well, just in case...</em> And no, I won't tell you the signal, I'm
    not dumb."
622:
  text: |-
    "I hadn't planned to ask," McGonagall said. She seemed to fold in on herself,
    and suddenly looked very old, and very tired. "This has been an exhausting day,
    Mr. Potter. Can we get your trunk, and send you home? I will trust you not to
    speak upon this matter until I have had time to think. Keep in mind that there
    are only two other people in the whole world who know about this matter, and
    they are Headmaster Albus Dumbledore and Professor Severus Snape."
623:
  text: |-
    So. New information; that was a peace offering. Harry nodded in acceptance, and
    turned his head to look forward, and started walking again, as his blood slowly
    began to warm over once more.
624:
  text: |-
    "So now I've got to find some way to kill an immortal Dark Wizard," Harry said,
    and sighed in frustration. "I really wish you had told me that <em>before</em> I
    started shopping."
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
625:
  text: |-
    The trunk shop was more richly appointed than any other shop Harry had visited;
    the curtains were lush and delicately patterned, the floor and walls of stained
    and polished wood, and the trunks occupied places of honor on polished ivory
    platforms. The salesman was dressed in robes of finery only a cut below those of
    Lucius Malfoy, and spoke with exquisite, oily politeness to both Harry and
    Professor McGonagall.
626:
  text: |-
    Harry had asked his questions, and had gravitated to a trunk of heavy-looking
    wood, not polished but warm and solid, carved with the pattern of a guardian
    dragon whose eyes shifted to look at anyone nearing it. A trunk charmed to be
    light, to shrink on command, to sprout small clawed tentacles from its bottom
    and squirm after its owner. A trunk with two drawers on each of four sides that
    each slid out to reveal compartments as deep as the whole trunk. A lid with four
    locks each of which would reveal a different space inside. And - this was the
    important part - a handle on the bottom which slid out a frame containing a
    staircase leading down into a small, lighted room that would hold, Harry
    estimated, around twelve bookcases.
627:
  text: |-
    If they made luggages like this, Harry didn't know why anyone bothered owning a
    house.
628:
  text: |-
    One hundred and eight golden Galleons. That was the price of a good trunk,
    lightly used. At around fifty British pounds to the Galleon, that was enough to
    buy a second-hand car. It would be more expensive than everything else Harry had
    ever bought in his whole life all put together.
629:
  text: |-
    Ninety-seven Galleons. That was how much was left in the bag of gold Harry had
    been allowed to take out of Gringotts.
630:
  text: |-
    Professor McGonagall wore a look of chagrin upon her face. After a long day's
    shopping she hadn't needed to ask Harry how much gold was left in the bag, after
    the salesman quoted his price, which meant the Professor could do good mental
    arithmetic without pen and paper. Once again, Harry reminded himself that
    <em>scientifically illiterate</em> was not at all the same thing as
    <em>stupid.</em>
631:
  text: |-
    "I'm sorry, young man," said Professor McGonagall. "This is entirely my fault. I
    would offer to take you back to Gringotts, but the bank will be closed for all
    but emergency services now."
632:
  text: |-
    Harry looked at her, wondering...
633:
  text: |-
    "Well," sighed Professor McGonagall, as she swung on one heel, "we may as well
    go, I suppose."
634:
  text: |-
    ...she <em>hadn't</em> lost it completely when a child had dared defy her. She
    hadn't been happy, but she had <em>thought</em> instead of exploding in fury. It
    might have just been that there was an immortal Dark Lord to fight - that she
    had needed Harry's goodwill. But most adults wouldn't have been capable of
    thinking even that much; wouldn't consider <em>future consequences</em> at all,
    if someone lower in status had refused to obey them...<em><br/></em>
635:
  text: |-
    "Professor?" Harry said.
636:
  text: |-
    The witch turned back and looked at him.
637:
  text: |-
    Harry took a deep breath. He needed to be a little angry for what he wanted to
    try now, there was no way he'd have the courage to do it otherwise. <em>She
    didn't listen to me,</em> he thought to himself, <em>I would have taken more
    gold but she didn't want to listen...</em> Focusing his entire world on
    McGonagall and the need to bend this conversation to his will, he spoke.
638:
  text: |-
    "Professor, you thought one hundred Galleons would be more than enough for a
    trunk. That's why you didn't bother warning me before it went down to ninety-
    seven. Which is just the sort of thing the research studies show - that's what
    happens when people think they're leaving themselves a <em>little</em> error
    margin. They're not pessimistic enough. If it'd been up to me, I'd have taken
    <em>two hundred</em> Galleons just to be sure. There was plenty of money in that
    vault, and I could have put back any extra later. But I thought you wouldn't let
    me do it. I thought you'd be angry at me just for asking. Was I wrong?"
639:
  text: |-
    "I suppose I must confess that you are right," said Professor McGonagall. "But,
    young man -"
640:
  text: |-
    "That sort of thing is the reason why I have trouble trusting adults." Somehow
    Harry kept his voice steady. "Because they get angry if you even <em>try</em> to
    reason with them. To them it's defiance and insolence and a challenge to their
    higher tribal status. If you try to talk to them they get <em>angry.</em> So if
    I had anything <em>really</em> <em>important</em> to do, I wouldn't be able to
    trust you. Even if you listened with deep concern to whatever I said - because
    that's also part of the <em>role</em> of someone playing a concerned adult -
    you'd never change your actions, you wouldn't actually behave differently,
    because of anything I said."
641:
  text: |-
    The salesman was watching them both with unabashed fascination.
642:
  text: |-
    "I can understand your point of view," Professor McGonagall said eventually. "If
    I sometimes seem too strict, please remember that I have served as Head of
    Gryffindor House for what feels like several thousand years."
643:
  text: |-
    Harry nodded and continued. "So - suppose I had a way to get more Galleons from
    my vault <em>without</em> us going back to Gringotts, but it involved me
    violating the role of an obedient child. Would I be able to trust you with that,
    even though you'd have to step outside your own role as Professor McGonagall to
    take advantage of it?"
644:
  text: |-
    "<em>What?</em> " said Professor McGonagall.
645:
  text: |-
    "To put it another way, if I could make today have happened differently, so that
    we <em>didn't</em> take too little money with us, would that be all right even
    though it would involve a child being insolent to an adult in retrospect?"
646:
  text: |-
    "I... suppose..." the witch said, looking quite puzzled.
647:
  text: |-
    Harry took out the mokeskin pouch, and said, "Eleven Galleons originally from my
    family vault."
648:
  text: |-
    And there was gold in Harry's hand.
649:
  text: |-
    For a moment Professor McGonagall's mouth gaped wide, then her jaw snapped shut
    and her eyes narrowed and the witch bit out, "<em>Where</em> did you get that -"
650:
  text: |-
    "From my family vault, like I said."
651:
  text: |-
    "<em>How?</em> "
652:
  text: |-
    "Magic."
653:
  text: |-
    "That's hardly an answer!" snapped Professor McGonagall, and then stopped,
    blinking.
654:
  text: |-
    "No, it isn't, is it? I <em>ought</em> to claim that it's because I
    experimentally discovered the true secrets of how the pouch works and that it
    can actually retrieve objects from anywhere, not just its own inside, if you
    phrase the request correctly. But actually it's from when I fell into that pile
    of gold before and I shoved some Galleons into my pocket. Anyone who understands
    pessimism knows that money is something you might need quickly and without much
    warning. So now are you angry at me for defying your authority? Or glad that we
    succeeded in our important mission?"
655:
  text: |-
    The salesman's eyes were wide like saucers.
656:
  text: |-
    And the tall witch stood there, silent.
657:
  text: |-
    "Discipline at Hogwarts <em>must</em> be enforced," she said after almost a full
    minute. "For the sake of <em>all</em> the students. And that <em>must</em>
    include courtesy and obedience from you to <em>all</em> professors."
658:
  text: |-
    "I understand, Professor McGonagall."
659:
  text: |-
    "Good. Now let us buy that trunk and go home."
660:
  text: |-
    Harry felt like throwing up, or cheering, or fainting, or <em>something</em>.
    That was the first time his careful reasoning had ever worked on
    <em>anyone</em>. Maybe because it was also the first time he had something
    really serious that an adult needed from him, but still -
661:
  text: |-
    Minerva McGonagall, +1 point.
662:
  text: |-
    Harry bowed, and gave the bag of gold and the extra eleven Galleons into
    McGonagall's hands. "Thank you very much, Professor. Can you finish up the
    purchase for me? I've got to visit the lavatory."
663:
  text: |-
    The salesman, unctuous once more, pointed toward a door set into the wall with a
    gold-handled knob. As Harry started to walk away, he heard the salesman ask in
    his oily voice, "May I inquire as to who that was, Madam McGonagall? I take it
    he is Slytherin - third-year, perhaps? - and from a prominent family, but I did
    not recognise -"
664:
  text: |-
    The slam of the lavatory door cut off his words, and after Harry had identified
    the lock and pressed it into place, he grabbed the magical self-cleaning towel
    and, with shaky hands, wiped moisture off his forehead. Harry's entire body was
    sheathed in sweat which had soaked clear through his Muggle clothing, though at
    least it didn't show through the robes.
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
665:
  text: |-
    The sun was setting and it was very late indeed, by the time they stood again in
    the courtyard of the Leaky Cauldron, the silent leaf-dusted interface between
    magical Britain's Diagon Alley and the entire Muggle world. (That was one
    <em>awfully</em> decoupled economy...) Harry was to go to a phone box and call
    his father, once he was on the other side. He didn't need to worry about his
    luggage being stolen, apparently. His trunk had the status of a major magical
    item, something that most Muggles wouldn't notice; that was part of what you
    could get in the wizarding world, if you were willing to pay the price of a
    secondhand car.
666:
  text: |-
    "So here we part ways, for a time," Professor McGonagall said. She shook her
    head in wonderment. "This has been the strangest day of my life for... many a
    year. Since the day I learned that a child had defeated You-Know-Who. I wonder
    now, looking back, if that was the last reasonable day of the world."
667:
  text: |-
    Oh, like <em>she</em> had anything to complain about. <em>You think your
    day</em> <em>was surreal? Try mine.</em>
668:
  text: |-
    "I was very impressed with you today," Harry said to her. "I should have
    remembered to compliment you out loud, I was awarding you points in my head and
    everything."
669:
  text: |-
    "Thank you, Mr. Potter," said Professor McGonagall. "If you had already been
    sorted into a House I would have deducted so many points that your grandchildren
    would still be losing the House Cup."
670:
  text: |-
    "Thank <em>you</em>, Professor." It was probably too early to call her Minnie.
671:
  text: |-
    This woman might well be the sanest adult Harry had ever met, despite her lack
    of scientific background. Harry was even considering offering her the number-two
    position in whatever group he formed to fight the Dark Lord, though he wasn't
    silly enough to say that out loud. <em>Now what would be a good name for
    that...? The Death Eater Eaters?</em>
672:
  text: |-
    "I'll see you again soon, when school starts," Professor McGonagall said. "And,
    Mr. Potter, about your wand -"
673:
  text: |-
    "I know what you're going to ask," Harry said. He took out his precious wand
    and, with a deep twinge of inner pain, flipped it over in his hand, presenting
    her with the handle. "Take it. I hadn't planned to do anything, not a single
    thing, but I don't want you to have nightmares about me blowing up my house."
674:
  text: |-
    Professor McGonagall shook her head rapidly. "Oh no, Mr. Potter! That isn't
    done. I only meant to warn you not to <em>use</em> your wand at home, since the
    Ministry can detect underage magic and it is prohibited without supervision."
675:
  text: |-
    "Ah," Harry said. "That sounds like a very sensible rule. I'm glad to see the
    wizarding world takes that sort of thing seriously."
676:
  text: |-
    Professor McGonagall peered hard at him. "You really mean that."
677:
  text: |-
    "Yes," Harry said. "I get it. Magic is dangerous and the rules are there for
    good reasons. Certain other matters are also dangerous. I get that too. Remember
    that I am not stupid."
678:
  text: |-
    "I am unlikely ever to forget it. Thank you, Harry, that does make me feel
    better about entrusting you with certain things. Goodbye for now."
679:
  text: |-
    Harry turned to go, into the Leaky Cauldron and out towards the Muggle world.
680:
  text: |-
    As his hand touched the back door's handle, he heard a last whisper from behind
    him.

      <p>These are well-spotted as suspicious!</p>
      <p>
        While the obvious interpretation of the mysterious whisper is Dumbledore, I
        was also thinking that if fanfiction of HPMOR someday became sufficiently
        popular, then it would be very hard to Peggy Sue HPMOR. So the mysterious
        whisper is also potentially a Reverse Peggy Sue plot hook, as the final
        whisper originating from the disastrous universe where Harry never met
        Hermione.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        I never did find a good place for Harry and Hermione to talk about how many
        wizards, not just seers, might feel rather vague pressures in the presence of
        temporally important things... but because so many different people claimed to
        feel that they needed to do something important, or that they sure knew how
        the future would go, and then were proven wrong, this more widespread temporal
        sense became Disreputable and Low-Status. And so the High-Status thing to
        claim was that only Official Seers ever had anything to do with prophecy, and
        make fun of anyone not an Official Seer who claimed to feel any kind of
        temporal pressure, and the textbooks all said it was only seers.
      </p>
      <p>Although I did manage to put in this one part in Ch. 116:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          She was aware, in the back of her mind, that if the Quidditch rules really
          did change starting here and now, then this was the most important thing
          she'd ever do. She could almost feel the pressure of Time twisting around
          her as though the fate of Quidditch Itself were being settled this very day,
          and she was standing close to the center of it... though she hadn't gotten
          high-enough scores in Divination to actually sense anything like that, of
          course.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>And of course there's this in Ch. 88:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          He should have slowed down for safety, but there was a tension rising in
          him, a sourceless dread. He couldn't slow down, something terrible would
          happen if he slowed down...
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>and</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          The pressure in Harry's mind still rising, like a physical hand squeezing
          his chest, he had to find Hermione and he had no other notion of where she
          could be
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        So yes, the model in HPMOR has always been that in moments of sufficiently
        great temporal pressure, non-seers can also feel something.
      </p>

    Headmaster Albus Dumbledore leaned forward over his desk. His twinkling eyes
    peered out at Minerva. "So, my dear, how did you find Harry?"
