    Harry had walked into the Great Hall, looked around only once, grabbed enough
    calories to sustain himself, walked out, put on his Cloak again and found a
    small random corner in which to eat. Seeing the students at their tables -

    <em>Feeling revulsion when you look at other humans is not a good sign,</em>
    Hufflepuff said. <em>It's not reasonable to blame them for having not had your
    opportunities to learn what you've learned. Inaction in emergencies has nothing
    to do with people being selfish. Normalcy bias, like that plane crash in Tener-
    something where a few people ran out and escaped but most people just sat in
    their seats not moving while their plane was literally on fire. Look at how
    long</em> you <em>took to really start moving.</em>

    <em>It serves no useful purpose to hate</em>, said Gryffindor. <em>It's just
    going to damage your altruism.</em>

    <em>Try to figure out a training method you could use to prevent this from
    happening next time,</em> said Ravenclaw.
16260:

    <em>I'll go ahead and register the experimental prediction,</em> said Slytherin,
    <em>that we'll always observe exactly what would be predicted on the hypothesis
    that people cannot be saved, cannot be taught, and will never help us with
    anything important. Also, we need some way of keeping track of all the times I'm
    right.</em>

    Harry ignored the voices in his head and just ate slices of toast as fast as he
    could. It wasn't proper nutrition as a general policy, but one-time exceptions
    wouldn't hurt so long as he made them up the next day.
16262:
  text: |-
    In mid-bite, the blazing silver silhouette of a phoenix flew in from nowhere and
    said, in the voice of a tired old man, "Please remove your Cloak, Harry, I have
    a letter to deliver to you."
16263:
  text: |-
    Harry coughed for a bit, swallowed some toast which had gone down the wrong way,
    stood up, took off the Cloak of Invisibility, said aloud "Tell Dumbledore I said
    fine," and then sat down and continued to eat his toast.
16264:
  text: |-
    The toast had all gone by the time Albus Dumbledore walked up to Harry's nook,
    carrying folded sheets of paper in his hand; real paper, with lines, not
    wizard's parchment.
16265:
  text: |-
    "Is that -" Harry said.
16266:
  text: |-
    "From your father, and from your mother," said the old wizard. Wordlessly,
    Dumbledore handed over the folded sheets, and wordlessly Harry accepted them.
    The old wizard hesitated, then said quietly, "The Defense Professor has told me
    to restrain my counsel, and I thought the same thing myself when given time to
    think. I have always taken too long to learn the virtues of silence. But if I am
    mistaken, you need only say the word -"
16267:
  text: |-
    "You're not mistaken," Harry said. He looked down at the folded, lined papers,
    feeling the sickness in his gut that was how his body indicated a strong
    pessimistic prediction. His parents wouldn't actually disown him, and there
    wasn't much they could <em>do</em> to him (some part of himself was still afraid
    in a very visceral way of television privileges being taken away, no matter how
    little sense that made now). But he had stepped outside the role that parents
    would expect of children who, in their internal beliefs, were lower on the
    pecking order. It would be stupid to expect anything except complete indignant
    fury, all-out righteous rage, when you acted like that to someone who thought
    they were dominant over you.
16268:
  text: |-
    "After you read it," the Headmaster said, "I believe that you should come to the
    Great Hall at once, Harry. There is an announcement which you will wish to
    hear."
16269:
  text: |-
    "I'm not interested in funerals -"
16270:
  text: |-
    "No. Not that. Please, Harry, come as soon as you are done reading, and do so
    without your Cloak. Will you?"
16271:
  text: |-
    "Yes."
16272:
  text: |-
    The old wizard left.
16273:
  text: |-
    Harry had to force himself to open up the letter. The important thing was
    keeping your vulnerable friends and relations out of harm's way, it might be a
    cliche but so far as Harry could tell the logic was valid. Damaged relationships
    could be repaired later.
16274:
  text: |-
    The first letter said, in script handwriting that required a careful focus for
    Harry to read,
16275:
  text: |-
    <em>Son,</em>
16276:
  text: |-
    <em>No matter what you've read in books, keeping us out of harm's way is</em>
    <em>not</em> <em>as important as having adults who can help when you're in
    trouble. You decided without giving us a word in edgewise that we'd abandon you
    because of your 'dark side'. The ghost of Shakespeare knows that I've seen
    things in this last year that were not dreamt of in my philosophy - sometimes I
    wonder if your Mum isn't just humoring me and the authorities took you away when
    I started thinking you were a magic-user - so I can't deny that it's</em>
    <em>possible</em> <em>you've managed to develop some... I'm not quite sure what
    to call it, but 'dark side' seems premature if we don't know what's happening.
    Are you sure it's not a burgeoning telepathic talent and you're just picking up
    on the minds of other wizards around you? Their thoughts might seem evil to a
    child who grew up in a saner civilization. These are ungrounded speculations, I
    admit, but you shouldn't jump to conclusions either.</em>
16277:
  text: |-
    <em>The two most important things I have to tell you are this. First, son, I
    have</em> <em>every</em> <em>confidence in your ability to stay on the Light
    Side of the Force so long as you choose to, and I have every confidence that you
    will choose to. If there's some evil spirit whispering horrible suggestions in
    your ears, just ignore the suggestions. I</em> <em>do</em> <em>feel the need to
    emphasize that you should exercise special caution to ignore this evil spirit
    even if it is suggesting what seem like wonderful creative ideas and I hope I do
    not need to remind you about the Incident with the Science Project which would,
    I admit, make a deal more sense if you were struggling with demonic
    possession.</em>
16278:
  text: |-
    <em>The second thing I have to say is that you do not need to fear that Mum or I
    are going to abandon you because of your 'dark side'. We may not have expected
    you to gain magical powers or develop an affinity for black magic, but we did
    expect you to become a teenager. Which, if you think about it from your poor
    father's perspective, is already a sufficiently worrying prospect regarding a
    child who, by the age of nine, had been party to the summoning of a total of
    five fire engines. Children grow up. I won't lie to you and say that you will
    feel as close to us at 20 as you do now. But your Mum and I will feel just as
    close to you when we are old and grey and bothering the nursing-home robots.
    Children always grow up and away from their parents, and the parents always
    follow them from behind, offering helpful advice. Children grow up, and their
    personalities change, and they do things that their parents wish they would not
    do, and they act disrespectfully toward their parents and have them hauled out
    of their magical schools, and the parents go on loving them anyway. It is
    Nature's way. Though in the event that you have not yet hit puberty and your
    teenage years are proportionately worse than this, we reserve the right to
    reconsider this sentiment.</em>
16279:
  text: |-
    <em>No matter what is happening, remember that we love you and will always love
    you no matter what. I don't know if our love has any magical power under your
    rules, but if it does, don't hesitate to call on it.</em>
16280:
  text: |-
    <em>With all of this said... Harry, what you did there is not acceptable. I
    think you know that. And I also know that it is not the time to lecture you on
    it. But you must write and tell us what is happening. I can understand very well
    why you'd want us taken out of your school at once, and I know we can't force
    you to do anything, but please, Harry, be reasonable and realize how terrified
    we must be.</em>
16281:
  text: |-
    <em>I would like to tell you that you are absolutely forbidden to mess around
    with any magic that the adults around you consider the least bit unsafe, but for
    all I know, the teachers at your school are giving everyone lessons in advanced
    necromancy every Monday. Please, please exercise as much caution as your
    situation permits, whatever your situation may be. Despite your very hurried
    summary we don't have the slightest idea what is happening and I hope that you
    will write us as much as you can. It is clear that you are, at least in some
    ways, growing up, and I will</em> <em>try</em> <em>not to act like the
    children's-book parent who only makes things worse - though I hope you
    appreciate how hard this is - and your Mum has said a number of frightening
    things to me about how wizardry stays secret and how I might get</em>
    <em>you</em> <em>into trouble by making waves. I cannot tell you to avoid
    anything unsafe, because your school is unsafe and your Headmaster will not let
    you leave. I can't tell you that you shouldn't take responsibility for anything
    happening around you, because for all I know there are other children in
    trouble. But remember that it is</em> <em>not</em> <em>your moral responsibility
    to protect any adults, their place is to protect you, and every good adult would
    agree with that. Please write and tell us more as soon as you can.</em>
16282:
  text: |-
    <em>Both of us are desperate to help. If there is anything at all that we can
    do, please let us know at once. There is nothing which can happen to us which
    would be worse than learning that something had happened to you.</em>

    <em>Love,<br/></em><em>Dad.</em><em><br/></em>
16284:

    The last page said only,
16285:
  text: |-
    <em>You promised me that you wouldn't let magic take you away from me. I didn't
    raise you to be a boy who would break a promise to his Mum. You must come back
    safely, because you promised.</em>

    Slowly, Harry lowered the letters and began to walk towards the Great Hall. His
    hands were shaking, his whole body was shaking, and it seemed to be taking a
    very great deal of effort not to cry; which he knew wordlessly that he must not
    do. He hadn't cried through all of the day. And he wouldn't cry. Crying was the
    same as admitting defeat. And this wasn't over. So he wouldn't cry.

    The food served in the Great Hall that evening was plain that night, toast and
    butter and jam, water and orange juice, oatmeal and other simple fare, without
    dessert. Some students had worn simple black robes without their House colors.
    Others had still worn theirs. It should have been cause for argument, but there
    was instead a quietness, the sound of people eating without talking. It took two
    sides to make a debate, and one of the sides, this night, was not much
    interested in debating.

    Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall sat at the Head Table and did not eat.
    She should have. Perhaps she would in a short while. But she could not force
    herself to do it now.
16290:
  text: |-
    For a Gryffindor there was only one path. It had taken Minerva only a short time
    to remember that, when after the Defense Professor's urgings her mind had stayed
    empty of clever plots to try. That was not a Gryffindor's way; or perhaps she
    ought to say only that it was not <em>her</em> way, Albus did seem to try his
    hand at plotting... and yet when she thought back on their history, there were
    no plots at the moment of crisis, no cleverness and games in the last resort.
    For Albus Dumbledore, as for her, the rule <em>in extremis</em> was to decide
    what was the right thing to do, and do it no matter the cost to yourself. Even
    if it meant breaking your bounds, or changing your role, or letting go of your
    picture of yourself. That was the last resort of Gryffindor.
16291:
  text: |-
    Through a side entrance of the Great Hall she saw Harry Potter quietly slip in.
16292:
  text: |-
    It was time.
16293:
  text: |-
    Professor Minerva McGonagall rose from her chair, straightened the worn point on
    her hat, walked slowly to the lectern before the Head Table.
16294:
  text: |-
    The sounds in the Great Hall, already muted, fell away entirely as all students
    turned to look at her.
16295:
  text: |-
    "By now you have all heard," she said, her voice not quite steady. <em>That
    Hermione Granger is dead.</em> She didn't say those words aloud, since they had
    all heard. "Somehow, a troll was infiltrated into the castle Hogwarts without
    alarm from our ancient wards. Somehow this troll succeeded in injuring a
    student, without alarm from the wards until the point of her death.
    Investigations are underway to determine how this has occurred. The Board of
    Governors is meeting to determine how Hogwarts will respond. In due time justice
    shall be served. Meanwhile there is another matter of justice, which must be
    handled at once. George Weasley, Fred Weasley, please come forward to stand
    before us all."
16296:
  text: |-
    The Weasley twins exchanged glances where they sat at the Gryffindor table, and
    then stood up and walked toward her, slowly, reluctantly; and Minerva realized
    then that the Weasley twins thought that they were to be expelled.
16297:
  text: |-
    They honestly thought that she would expel them.
16298:
  text: |-
    That was what the picture of Professor McGonagall who lived in her head had
    wrought.
16299:
  text: |-
    The Weasley twins walked over to the lectern, looking up at her with faces that
    were frightened, but resolute; and she felt something in her heart break a
    little further.
16300:
  text: |-
    "I am not going to expel you," she said, and was saddened further by the
    surprised look on their faces. "Fred Weasley, George Weasley, turn and face your
    classmates, let them see you."
16301:
  text: |-
    Still looking surprised, the Weasley twins did so.
16302:
  text: |-
    She drew up all the steel in her heart, and said what was right.
16303:
  text: |-
    "I am ashamed," said Minerva McGonagall, "of the events of this day. I am
    ashamed that there were only two of you. Ashamed of what I have done to
    Gryffindor. Of all the Houses, it should have been Gryffindor to help when
    Hermione Granger was in need, when Harry Potter called for the brave to aid him.
    It was true, a seventh-year could have held back a mountain troll while
    searching for Miss Granger. And you should have believed that the Head of House
    Gryffindor," her voice broke, "would have believed in you. If you disobeyed her
    to do what was right, in events she had not foreseen. And the reason you did not
    believe this, is that I have never shown it to you. I did not believe in you. I
    did not believe in the virtues of Gryffindor itself. I tried to stamp out your
    defiance, instead of training your courage to wisdom. Whatever the Sorting Hat
    saw in me that led it to place me in Gryffindor, I have betrayed it. I have
    offered my resignation to the Headmaster as Deputy Headmistress and as the Head
    of House Gryffindor."

16304:
  text: |-
    There were cries of shock and dismay, and not only from the Gryffindor Table, as
    Harry's heart froze within his chest. Harry needed to run forward, say
    something, he hadn't meant for <em>this</em> to -
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
16305:
  text: |-
    Minerva took another breath, and continued. "However, the Headmaster has
    declined to accept my resignation," she said. "So I will continue to serve, and
    try to undo what I have wrought. Somehow I must find a way to teach my students
    how to do what is right. Not what is safe, not what is easy, not what we are
    told to do. If all I can teach you is to turn in your essays on time, there
    might as well not be a House Gryffindor. This road will be more difficult for
    me, and maybe for all of us. But I know now that before I was only taking the
    easy path."
16306:
  text: |-
    She stepped down from the lectern, moved down to where the Weasley twins stood.
16307:
  text: |-
    "Fred Weasley, George Weasley," she said. "The two of you have not always done
    what is right. The path of wisdom does not lie in flagrant and needless defiance
    of authority. And yet today you proved to be the last of our House to survive my
    mistakes. Because it was the right thing to do, you defied a threat of expulsion
    and risked your lives to face a mountain troll. For your astounding courage that
    honors your House to have you, I award each of you two hundred points for
    Gryffindor."
16308:
  text: |-
    Again the look of shock on their faces, again the pain like a knife through her
    heart.
16309:
  text: |-
    She turned to face the other students.
16310:
  text: |-
    "I will not award any points to Ravenclaw," she said. "I suspect that Mr. Potter
    would not want them. If I am wrong, he may correct me and take as many House
    points as he pleases. But for whatever it is worth, Mr. Potter, I am," her voice
    faltered, "I am sorry -"

16311:
  text: |-
    "<em>Stop!</em> " Harry screamed, and then, again, "Stop." The word sticking in
    his throat. "You don't have to, Professor." Something inside him was twisting,
    threatening to split him open, like a giant's hands wrenching at him to tear him
    in half. "And, and you shouldn't forget Susan Bones, and Ron Weasley - they also
    helped, they should get House points too -"
16312:
  text: |-
    "Miss Bones and the young Weasley?" said Professor McGonagall. "Rubeus said
    nothing of that - what did they do?"
16313:
  text: |-
    <em>"</em>Miss Bones tried to stun Mr. Hagrid when he tried to stop me, and Mr.
    Weasley shot Neville when Neville tried to stop me. They should both get points,
    and, and so should Neville," Harry hadn't thought to imagine it before, the way
    Neville must be feeling now, but the instant he'd thought, he knew, "because
    Neville tried to do something, even if it wasn't the right thing, doing what's
    right is the <em>second</em> lesson, you can start practicing that after you
    learn to do anything at all -"
16314:
  text: |-
    "Ten points to Hufflepuff, Miss Bones," Professor McGonagall said, her voice
    breaking in the middle. "Ten points to Gryffindor, Ron Weasley, your family has
    done itself exceeding proud, this day. And ten points to Hufflepuff for Neville
    Longbottom, for standing up to Mr. Potter and doing what he thought was right -"
16315:
  text: |-
    <em>"You shouldn't!</em> " screamed a young voice from the Hufflepuff table,
    followed by a single choking sound.
16316:
  text: |-
    Harry looked there, and then quickly looked back at Professor McGonagall and
    said, as steadily as he could, "Neville's right, actually, you can't award
    literally zero points for the part where you get the action correct, that sends
    the wrong message too, but he was halfway there so it could be five points
    instead."
16317:
  text: |-
    Professor McGonagall looked, for a moment, like she couldn't think of what to
    say; but then her eyes went to Neville's place at the table, and she said, "As
    you wish, Mr. Potter. What is it, Miss Bones?"
16318:
  text: |-
    Harry looked and saw that Susan Bones had stepped forward, wiping at her own
    eyes, and the Hufflepuff girl said, "Actually - Professor McGonagall - General
    Potter didn't see it - but Captain Weasley and I weren't the only ones who tried
    to get in Mr. Hagrid's way, after he ran out. Before some of the older students
    stopped us. But we managed to slow Mr. Hagrid down a minute, so General Potter
    could get away."
16319:
  text: |-
    "You've got to give them points too," said Ron Weasley from the Gryffindor
    table. "Or I won't take any."
16320:
  text: |-
    "Who else?" said Professor McGonagall, her voice a bit unsteady.
16321:
  text: |-
    Seven other children stood up.
16322:
  text: |-
    <em>What was that our Slytherin side was saying about predicting nothing would
    ever work?</em> said Hufflepuff.
16323:
  text: |-
    Something in Harry cracked, so that he had to exert all his force to hold
    himself together.
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
16324:
  text: |-
    When all had been said, and all had been done, Minerva went to where Harry
    Potter stood. Though it was not her greatest skill she cast a ward about them to
    blur vision, and muffled sounds with another thought.
16325:
  text: |-
    "You, you didn't have to -" said Harry Potter. "You shouldn't have said -" He
    sounded like he was choking. "P-Professor, everything I said to you was hurtful,
    and hateful, and wrong -"
16326:
  text: |-
    "I already knew that, Harry," she said. "Even so, I wished to do better." There
    was a feeling of lightness in her chest, much as one might experience after
    stepping off a cliff, when your legs no longer had to hold your body upright.
    She wasn't sure she could do this, she did not know the way; and yet for the
    first time it seemed possible that Hogwarts wouldn't become a sad ghost of its
    former self, when she became its Headmistress.
16327:
  text: |-
    Harry stared at her, then made a odd noise that sounded like it had been forced
    from his throat, and covered his face in his hands.
16328:
  text: |-
    So she knelt down, and hugged him. It might go wrong, but it might also go
    right, and she would not let that uncertainty stop her; it was time she began to
    learn a Gryffindor's courage, so that she could teach it in turn.
16329:

    "I had a sister once," she whispered. Just that, and nothing more.

    <em>Just to make sure,</em> said some part of Harry, while the rest of him
    sobbed into Professor McGonagall's arms, <em>this doesn't mean we've accepted
    Hermione's death, right?</em>
16331:
  text: |-
    <em>NO</em> said all the rest of him, every part of his mind in unanimous
    agreement, warmth and cold and a hidden place of steel. <em>Never, ever,
    forever.</em>

    And an ancient wizard to whom that ward meant nothing gazed upon them both, the
    witch and the weeping young wizard. Albus Dumbledore was smiling with a strange
    sad look in his eyes, like someone who has taken one more step toward a foreseen
    destination.

    The Defense Professor watched them both, the woman and the crying boy. His eyes

    It wasn't until the next morning that it was discovered that Hermione Granger's
