    <em>The first meeting:</em>
16337:
  text: |-
    At 6:07am on April 17th, 1992 the Sun was just rising above the horizon as seen
    from the castle Hogwarts, filtering in through drawn curtains in the Ravenclaw
    first-year boys' dorm to provide a gentle light, red-orange for dawn and little-
    changed by the white fabric covering the windows, not yet waking boys more
    accustomed to winter's schedule.
16338:
  text: |-
    In one bed among many, Harry Potter slept the sleep of the just exhausted.
16339:
  text: |-
    Quietly the door opened.
16340:
  text: |-
    Quietly a figure walked across the floor.
16341:
  text: |-
    That figure came to Harry Potter's bed.
16342:
  text: |-
    The figure laid a hand on the shoulder of the sleeping boy, who started and
    shrieked.
16343:
  text: |-
    No others heard.
16344:
  text: |-
    "Mr. Potter," the small man squeaked, "the Headmaster has requested your
    presence immediately."
16345:
  text: |-
    Slowly the boy sat up in bed, his hands momentarily fiddling beneath the covers.
    He'd expected to feel much worse, waking up this morning. It felt... wrong, that
    his brain functioned now, that his thoughts still moved, that he wasn't
    incapacitated with weeping for at least a week. The boy knew that it wouldn't
    have been an adaptive response, for brains to evolve to do that. His dark side,
    certainly, would not do that. Even so, it still felt wrong to be alive and
    lucid, this morning.
16346:
  text: |-
    But his resolution to revive Hermione Granger felt - sufficient, like he was
    already doing the right thing, bent on the right path, and she would be brought
    back, and that was all there was to it; grief would have been giving up. There
    was nothing left to decide, no ambiguity, no conflict to tear at him, and no
    need to remember what he'd <em>seen</em> -
16347:
  text: |-
    "I'll get dressed," Harry said.
16348:
  text: |-
    Professor Flitwick looked rather reluctant, but said in his high voice, "The
    Headmaster specified you were to be brought to his office directly and without
    pause, Mr. Potter. I'm sorry."
16349:
  text: |-
    Less than a minute later - Professor Flitwick had sent him straight to the
    Headmaster's office through the Hogwarts internal Floo - Harry found himself,
    still in his pajamas, facing Albus Dumbledore. The Deputy Headmistress was also
    sitting in another chair, and the Potions Master lurked nearby amid the weird
    devices, caught in a gaping yawn just as Harry had entered through the
    fireplace.
16350:
  text: |-
    "Harry," the Headmaster said without preamble, "before I say what I must say
    next, I tell you that Hermione Granger did truly die. The wards recorded it and
    informed me. The very stones spoke that a witch had died. I tested her body
    where it lay and those were Hermione Granger's true mortal remains, not any doll
    or likeness. There is no way known to wizardry by which death may be undone. All
    this being said, Hermione Granger's remains are now missing from the storeroom
    where they were placed, and where you guarded them. Did you take them, Harry
    Potter?"
16351:
  text: |-
    "No," Harry said, narrowing his eyes. A glance showed him that Severus was
    watching him intently.
16352:
  text: |-
    Dumbledore's gaze was also keen, though not unfriendly. "Is Hermione Granger's
    body in your possession?"
16353:
  text: |-
    "No."
16354:
  text: |-
    "Do you know where it is?"
16355:
  text: |-
    "No."
16356:
  text: |-
    "Do you know who took it?"
16357:
  text: |-
    "No," Harry said, then hesitated. "Besides the obvious probabilistic
    speculations which are not based upon any specific knowledge of mine."
16358:
  text: |-
    The old wizard nodded. "Do you know why it was taken?"
16359:
  text: |-
    "No. Besides the obvious speculations etcetera."
16360:
  text: |-
    "What would those be?" Sharp the ancient eyes.
16361:
  text: |-
    "If the enemy can notice you running off to consult the Weasley twins during
    class after Hermione was arrested, and find out about that magic map you said
    was stolen, then the enemy can wonder why I was guarding Hermione Granger's
    body. My turn. Did you arrange for Hermione's death in hopes of getting the
    money back from Lucius?"
16362:
  text: |-
    "<em>What?</em>â€¯" said Professor McGonagall.
16363:
  text: |-
    "No," said the old wizard.
16364:
  text: |-
    "Did you know or suspect that Hermione Granger would die?"
16365:
  text: |-
    "I did not know. As for suspicions, I placed her in the most strongly defended
    position I could, against Voldemort. I did not will her death, nor allow it, nor
    plan to benefit from it, Harry Potter. Now show me your pouch."
16366:
  text: |-
    "It's in my trunk -" Harry began.
16367:
  text: |-
    "Severus," said the old wizard, and the Potions Master moved forward. "Check his
    trunk as well, every compartment."
16368:
  text: |-
    "My trunk has wards."
16369:
  text: |-
    Severus Snape grinned mirthlessly and strode into the green flame.
16370:
  text: |-
    Dumbledore took out his long dark-grey wand and began to wave it close around
    Harry's hair, looking like a Muggle using a metal-detector. Before he had
    reached as far as Harry's neck, Dumbledore stopped.
16371:
  text: |-
    "The gem upon your ring," Dumbledore said. "It is no longer a clear diamond. It
    is brown, the color of Hermione Granger's eyes, and the color of her hair."
16372:
  text: |-
    A sudden tension filled the room.
16373:
  text: |-
    "That's my father's rock," Harry said. "Transfigured the same as before. I just
    did it to remember Hermione -"
16374:
  text: |-
    "I must be sure. Take off that ring, Harry, and place it upon my desk."
16375:
  text: |-
    Slowly, Harry did so, removing the gem and setting the ring off to the other
    side of the desk.
16376:
  text: |-
    Dumbledore pointed his wand at the gem and -
16377:
  text: |-
    A large, undistinguished grey rock jumped into the air from the force of its
    sudden expansion, hit some invisible barrier in the air above, and then fell
    with a loud crack upon the Headmaster's desk,
16378:
  text: |-
    "There's another half-hour of work for me, Transfiguring it again," Harry said
    evenly.
16379:
  text: |-
    Dumbledore resumed his examination. Harry had to remove his left shoe, and take
    off the toe-ring that was his emergency portkey if someone kidnapped him and
    took him outside the wards of Hogwarts (and didn't put up anti-Apparition, anti-
    portkey, anti-phoenix, and anti-time-looping wards, which Severus had warned
    Harry that any inner-circle Death Eater would certainly do). It was verified
    that the magic radiating from the toe-ring was indeed the magic of a portkey,
    and not the magic of a Transfiguration. The rest of Harry was deemed clear.
16380:
  text: |-
    Not long after, the Potions Master returned, bearing Harry's pouch, and several
    other magical things which had been in Harry's trunk, which the Headmaster also
    examined, one by one, even to all the items remaining within the healer's kit.
16381:
  text: |-
    "Can I go now?" Harry said when it was all done, putting as much cold as he
    could into his voice. He took up his pouch, and began the process of feeding the
    grey rock into it. The empty ring went back on his finger.
16382:
  text: |-
    The old wizard breathed out, slipping his wand back into his sleeve. "I
    <em>am</em> sorry," he said. "I had to know. Harry... the Dark Lord has taken
    Hermione Granger's remains, it seems. I cannot think of anything he would gain
    thereby, except to send her corpse against you as an Inferius. Severus shall
    give you certain potions to keep about your person. Be warned now, and be
    prepared for when you must do what must be done."
16383:
  text: |-
    "Will the Inferius have Hermione's mind?"
16384:
  text: |-
    "No -"
16385:
  text: |-
    "Then it's not her. Can I go? At least to change out of my pyjamas."
16386:
  text: |-
    "There is other news, but I shall be brief. The wards of Hogwarts record that no
    foreign creature has entered, and that it was the Defense Professor who killed
    Hermione Granger."
16387:
  text: |-
    "Um," Harry said.
16388:
  text: |-
    <em>Thought 1: But I saw the troll kill Hermione.</em>
16389:
  text: |-
    <em>Thought 2: Professor Quirrell Memory-Charmed me and set up the scene that
    Dumbledore saw when he arrived.</em>
16390:
  text: |-
    <em>Thought 3: Professor Quirrell can't do that, his magic can't touch mine. I
    saw that in Azkaban -</em>
16391:
  text: |-
    <em>Thought 4: Can I trust those memories?</em>
16392:
  text: |-
    <em>Thought 5: There was clearly some sort of debacle at Azkaban, we wouldn't
    have needed a rocket if Professor Quirrell hadn't fallen unconscious, and why'd
    he be unconscious if not -</em>
16393:
  text: |-
    <em>Thought 6: Did I ever actually go to Azkaban at all?</em>
16394:
  text: |-
    <em>Thought 7: I clearly practiced controlling Dementors at some point before I
    scared that Dementor in the Wizengamot. And</em> that <em>was in the
    newspapers.</em>
16395:
  text: |-
    <em>Thought 8: Am I accurately remembering the newspapers?</em>
16396:
  text: |-
    "Um," Harry said again. "That spell seriously ought to be Unforgiveable. You
    think Professor Quirrell could have Memory-Charmed -"
16397:
  text: |-
    "No. I went back through time and placed certain instruments to record
    Hermione's last battle, which I could not quite bear to watch in my own person."
    The old wizard looked very grim indeed. "Your guess was right, Harry Potter.
    Voldemort sabotaged everything we gave Hermione to protect her. Her broomstick
    lay dead in her hands. Her invisibility cloak did not conceal her. The troll
    walked in the sunlight unharmed; it was no stray creature, but a weapon pure and
    aimed. And it was indeed the troll who killed her, with strength alone, so that
    my wards and webs to detect hostile magics went for naught. The Defense
    Professor never crossed her path."
16398:
  text: |-
    Harry swallowed, shut his eyes, and thought. "So this was an attempted frame on
    Professor Quirrell. Somehow. It does seem to be the enemy's <em>modus
    operandi.</em> Troll eats Hermione Granger, check the wards, oh look actually
    the Defense Professor did it, same as last year... no. No, that can't be right."
16399:
  text: |-
    "Why not, Mr. Potter?" said the Potions Master. "It seems obvious enough to me
    -"
16400:
  text: |-
    "That's the problem."
16401:
  text: |-
    <em>The enemy is smart.</em>
16402:
  text: |-
    Slowly the fog of sleep was drifting out of Harry's mind, and after a full
    night's sleep his brain could see the things which hadn't been obvious the day
    before.
16403:
  text: |-
    Under standard literary convention... the enemy wasn't supposed to look over
    what you'd done, sabotage the magic items you'd handed out, and then send out a
    troll rendered undetectable by some means the heroes couldn't figure out even
    after the fact, so that you might as well have not defended yourself at all. In
    a book, the point-of-view usually stayed on the main characters. Having the
    enemy just bypass all the protagonists' work, as a result of planning and
    actions taken out of literary sight, would be a <em>diabolus ex machina,</em>
    and dramatically unsatisfying.
16404:
  text: |-
    But in real life the enemy would think that they were the main character, and
    they would also be clever, and think things through in advance, even if you
    didn't see them do it. That was why everything about this felt so disjointed,
    with parts unexplained and seemingly inexplicable. How had Lucius felt, when
    Harry had threatened Dumbledore with breaking Azkaban? How had the Aurors above
    Azkaban felt, seeing the broomstick rise up on a torch of fire?
16405:
  text: |-
    <em>The enemy is smart.</em>
16406:
  text: |-
    "The enemy knew perfectly well that you'd turn back time to check what really
    happened to Hermione, especially since the troll getting into Hogwarts at all
    tells us that somebody can fool the wards." Harry shut his eyes, thinking
    harder, trying to put himself into the enemy's shoes. Why would he, or his dark
    side, have done something like - "We're meant to conclude that the enemy has
    control of what the wards tell us. But that's actually something the enemy can
    only do with difficulty, or under special conditions; they're trying to create a
    false appearance of omnipotence." <em>Like I would.</em> "Later, hypothetically,
    the wards show Professor Sinistra killing someone. We think the wards are just
    being fooled again, but really, Professor Sinistra was Legilimized and she
    <em>did</em> do it."
16407:
  text: |-
    "Unless that is precisely what the Dark Lord expects us to think," said Severus
    Snape, his brow furrowed in concentration. "In which case he does have control
    of the wards, and Professor Sinistra will be innocent."
16408:
  text: |-
    "Does the Dark Lord <em>really</em> use plots with that many levels of meta -"
16409:
  text: |-
    "Yes," said Dumbledore and Severus.
16410:
  text: |-
    Harry nodded distantly. "Then this could be a setup to either make us think the
    wards are telling the truth when they're lying, or a setup to make us think the
    wards are lying when they're telling the truth, depending on what level the
    enemy expects us to reason at. But if the enemy is planning to make us trust the
    wards - we would have trusted the wards anyway, if we'd been given no reason to
    distrust them. So there's no need to go to all the work of framing Professor
    Quirrell in a way that we would realize we were intended to discover, just to
    trick us into going meta -"
16411:
  text: |-
    "Not so," said Dumbledore. "If Voldemort has not fully mastered the wards, then
    the wards had to believe that some Professor's hand was at work. Else they would
    have cried out at Miss Granger's injury, and not only upon her death."
16412:
  text: |-
    Harry reached up a hand and rubbed at his brow, just beneath his hair.
16413:
  text: |-
    <em>Okay, serious question. If the enemy is that smart, why the heck am I still
    alive? Is it seriously that hard to poison someone, are there Charms and Potions
    and bezoars which can cure me of literally anything that could be slipped into
    my breakfast?</em> <em>Would the wards record it, trace the magic of the
    murderer?</em>
16414:
  text: |-
    <em>Could my</em> scar <em>contain the fragment of soul that's keeping the Dark
    Lord anchored to the world, so he doesn't want to kill me? Instead he's trying
    to drive off all my friends to weaken my spirit so he can take over my body?
    It'd explain the Parselmouth thing. The Sorting Hat might not be able to detect
    a lich-phylactery-thingy. Obvious problem 1, the Dark Lord is supposed to have
    made his lich-phylactery-thingy in 1943 by killing whatshername and framing Mr.
    Hagrid. Obvious problem 2, there's no such thing as souls.</em>
16415:
  text: |-
    <em>Though Dumbledore also thought that my blood was a key ingredient in a
    ritual to restore the Dark Lord's full strength, which would require keeping me
    alive until then... now there's a cheery thought.</em>
16416:
  text: |-
    "Well..." Harry said. "I'm sure of one thing."
16417:
  text: |-
    "And that is?"
16418:
  text: |-
    "Neville needs to be taken out of Hogwarts <em>now.</em> He's the obvious next
    target and no first-year student can survive this level of offense. We're lucky
    Neville wasn't assassinated yesterday evening, the enemy doesn't have to wait
    until we're finished mourning to make their next move." <em>Why didn't the enemy
    strike while we were distracted?</em>
16419:
  text: |-
    Dumbledore exchanged glances with Severus, and then with the suddenly tight
    expression of Professor McGonagall. "Harry," said the old wizard, "if you send
    all your friends away yourself, that is just the same as if Voldemort -"
16420:
  text: |-
    "I will be <em>fine</em> I can do without Neville for a couple of extra months
    it's not like you were planning to make my friends stay here over the summer and
    that is just plain <em>not sufficient justification</em> to let him get killed!
    Professor McGonagall -"
16421:
  text: |-
    "I quite agree," said the Scottish witch. She frowned. "I extremely agree. I
    agree to the point where... I'm having some trouble figuring out how to express
    this, Albus..."
16422:
  text: |-
    "To the point where you're going to haul him out of there yourself, regardless
    of what anyone else says, because it's no excuse to say you were only following
    orders if Neville gets killed?" Harry said.
16423:
  text: |-
    Professor McGonagall closed her eyes briefly. "Yes, but surely there ought to be
    some way to be responsible without threats of unilateral action."
16424:
  text: |-
    The Headmaster sighed. "No need. Go, Minerva."
16425:
  text: |-
    "Wait," the Potions Master said, just as Professor McGonagall, moving rather
    swiftly, was taking a pinch of green dust from the Floo-vase. "We should not
    call attention to the boy, as the Headmaster called attention to the Weasley
    twins. It would be wiser, I think, if Mr. Longbottom's grandmother took him from
    Hogwarts. Let him stay in his Common Room for now; the Dark Lord does not seem
    able to act so openly."
16426:
  text: |-
    There was another long exchange of glances among the four, and finally Harry
    nodded, followed by Professor McGonagall.
16427:
  text: |-
    "In that case," said Harry, "I'm sure of one other thing."
16428:
  text: |-
    "And that is?" said Dumbledore.
16429:
  text: |-
    "I very much need to visit the washroom, and I would also like to change out of
    these pyjamas."
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
16430:
  text: |-
    "By the way," Harry said as he and the Headmaster emerged from Floo into the
    empty office of the Ravenclaw Head of House. "One last quick question I wanted
    to ask just you. That sword the Weasley twins pulled out of the Sorting Hat.
    That was the Sword of Gryffindor, wasn't it?"
16431:
  text: |-
    The old wizard turned, face neutral. "What makes you think that, Harry?"
16432:
  text: |-
    "The Sorting Hat yelled <em>Gryffindor!</em> just before handing it out, the
    sword had a ruby pommel and gold letters on the blade, and the Latin script said
    <em>Nothing better</em>. Just a hunch."
16433:
  text: |-
    "<em>Nihil supernum,</em>" said the old wizard. "That is not <em>quite</em> what
    it means."
16434:
  text: |-
    Harry nodded. "Mmhm. What'd you do with it?"
16435:
  text: |-
    "I retrieved it from where it fell, and placed it in a secure place," the old
    wizard said. He gave Harry a stern look. "I hope you are not greedy for it
    yourself, young Ravenclaw."
16436:
  text: |-
    "Not at all, just want to make sure you're not keeping it permanently from its
    rightful wielders. So the Weasley twins are the Heir of Gryffindor, then?"
16437:
  text: |-
    "The Heir of Gryffindor?" Dumbledore said, looking surprised. Then the old
    wizard smiled, blue eyes twinkling brightly. "Ah, Harry, Salazar Slytherin may
    have built a Chamber of Secrets into Hogwarts, but Godric Gryffindor was not
    much given to such extravagances. We have seen only that Godric left his Sword
    to the defense of Hogwarts, if a worthy student ever faced a foe they could not
    defeat alone."
16438:
  text: |-
    "That's not the same as saying no. Don't think I didn't notice that you didn't
    actually say no."
16439:
  text: |-
    "I did not live in those years, Harry, and I do not know all that Godric
    Gryffindor may or may not have done -"
16440:
  text: |-
    "Do you in fact assign greater than fifty percent subjective probability that
    there is something like a Heir of Gryffindor and one or both Weasley twins are
    it. Yes or no, evasion means yes. You're not going to succeed in distracting me,
    no matter how much I have to go to the bathroom."
16441:
  text: |-
    The old wizard sighed. "Yes, Fred and George Weasley are the Heir of Gryffindor.
    I beg you not to speak of it to them, not yet."
16442:
  text: |-
    Harry nodded, and turned to go. "I'm surprised," Harry said. "I read a little
    about Godric Gryffindor's historical life. The Weasley twins are... well,
    they're awesome in various ways, but they don't seem much like the Godric in the
    history books."
16443:
  text: |-
    "Only a man exceedingly proud and vain," Dumbledore said quietly, as he turned
    back to the Floo roaring up again with green flames, "would believe that his
    heir should be like himself, rather than like who he wished that he could be."
16444:
  text: |-
    The Headmaster stepped into green fire, and was gone.
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
16445:
  text: |-
    <em>The second meeting (in a small cubby off the Hufflepuff Common Room):</em>
16446:
  text: |-
    Neville Longbottom's face was drawn up in anguish, as he spoke with no one to
    hear, to the empty air.
16447:
  text: |-
    "Seriously," the empty air said back to him. "I'm wearing an invisibility cloak
    with extra anti-detection charms just to walk through the hallways because
    <em>I</em> don't want to be killed. My parents would have me out of Hogwarts in
    an instant if the Headmaster allowed it. Neville, your getting the heck out of
    Hogwarts is common sense, it has <em>nothing to do</em> with -"
16448:
  text: |-
    "I betrayed you, General," Neville said, his voice around as hollow as any
    normal eleven-year-old boy could reasonably manage. "I didn't even do it the
    Chaotic way. I conformed to authority and tried to make you conform to authority
    too. What's that you always say, about how in the Chaos Legion, a soldier who
    can only obey orders is useless?"
16449:
  text: |-
    "Neville," the empty air said firmly. The pressure of two hands, beneath thin
    cloth, came firmly to bear on Neville's shoulders; and the voice moved closer to
    him. "You weren't blindly obeying authority, you were trying to protect me. It's
    true that in this chaotic world, soldiers who can only follow rules and
    regulations are worthless. However, soldiers who follow rules for the sake of
    protecting their friends are -"
16450:
  text: |-
    "Slightly better than worthless?" Neville said bitterly.
16451:
  text: |-
    "<em>Significantly</em> better than worthless. Neville, you made an error of
    judgment. It cost me around six seconds. Now it could be that Hermione's
    injuries were just barely fatal, but even then, I don't think six seconds was
    actually enough time for the troll to take an extra bite of Hermione. In the
    counterfactual world where you didn't step in front of me, Hermione still died.
    Now, I could stand here listing out the first dozen ways that Hermione would be
    alive if I hadn't been stupid -"
16452:
  text: |-
    "You? <em>You</em> ran right out after her. <em>I'm</em> the one who tried to
    stop you. It's my fault if it's anyone's," Neville said bitterly.
16453:
  text: |-
    The empty air went silent at this for a while.
16454:
  text: |-
    "Wow," the empty air finally said. "Wow. That puts a pretty different
    perspective on things, I have to say. I'm going to remember this the next time I
    feel an impulse to blame myself for something. Neville, the term in the
    literature for this is 'egocentric bias', it means that you experience
    everything about your own life but you don't get to experience everything else
    that happens in the world. There was way, way more going on than you running in
    front of me. You're going to spend weeks remembering that thing you did there
    for six seconds, I can tell, but nobody else is going to bother thinking about
    it. Other people spend a lot less time thinking about your past mistakes than
    you do, just because you're not the center of their worlds. I <em>guarantee</em>
    to you that nobody except you has even <em>considered</em> blaming Neville
    Longbottom for what happened to Hermione. Not for a fraction of a second. You
    are being, if you will pardon the phrase, a silly-dilly. Now shut up and say
    goodbye."

    "I don't want to say goodbye," Neville said. His voice was trembling, but he
    managed not to cry. "I want to stay here and fight with you against - against
    whatever's happening."

    The empty air moved closer to him, and embraced him in a hug, and Harry Potter's
    voice whispered, "Tough luck."
