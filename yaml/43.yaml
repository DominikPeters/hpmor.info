    The gentle sun of January shone on the cold fields outside Hogwarts.
7729:
  text: |-
    For some of the students it was a study hour, and others had been let out of
    class. The first-years who'd signed up for it were practicing a certain spell, a
    spell that was most advantageously learned outdoors, beneath the bright sun and
    a clear blue sky, rather than within the confines of any classroom. Cookies and
    lemonade were also considered helpful.
7730:
  text: |-
    The early gestures of the spell were complex and precise; you twitched your wand
    once, twice, thrice, and four times with small tilts at exactly the right
    relative angles, you shifted your forefinger and thumb exactly the right
    distances...
7731:
  text: |-
    The Ministry thought this meant it was futile to try and teach anyone the spell
    before their fifth year. There had been a few known cases of younger children
    learning it, and this had been dismissed as "genius".
7732:
  text: |-
    It might not have been a very polite way of putting it, but Harry was beginning
    to see why Professor Quirrell had claimed that the Ministry Committee of
    Curriculum would have been of greater benefit to wizardkind if they had been
    used as landfill.
7733:
  text: |-
    So the gestures were complicated and delicate. That didn't stop you from
    learning it when you were eleven. It meant you had to be extra careful and
    practice each part for a lot longer than usual, that was all.
7734:
  text: |-
    Most Charms that could only be learned by older students were like that because
    they required more strength of magic than any young student could muster. But
    the Patronus Charm <em>wasn't</em> like that, it wasn't difficult because it
    needed too much magic, it was difficult because it took <em>more</em> than mere
    magic.
7735:
  text: |-
    It took the warm, happy feelings that you kept close in your heart, the loving
    memories, a different kind of strength that you didn't need for ordinary spells.
7736:
  text: |-
    Harry twitched his wand once, twice, thrice and four times, shifted his fingers
    exactly the right distances...
7737:
  text: |-
    <em>"Good luck at school, Harry. Do you think I bought you enough books?"</em>
7738:
  text: |-
    <em>"You can never have enough books... but you certainly tried, it was a
    really, really, really good try..."</em>
7739:
  text: |-
    It had brought tears to his eyes, the first time Harry had remembered and tried
    to put it into the spell.
7740:
  text: |-
    Harry brought the wand up and around and brandished it, a gesture that didn't
    have to be precise, only bold and defiant.
7741:
  text: |-
    "<em>Expecto Patronum!</em> " cried Harry.
7742:
  text: |-
    Nothing happened.
7743:
  text: |-
    Not a single flicker of light.
7744:
  text: |-
    When Harry looked up, Remus Lupin was still studying the wand, a rather troubled
    look on his faintly scarred face.
7745:
  text: |-
    Finally Remus shook his head. "I'm sorry, Harry," the man said quietly. "Your
    wandwork was exactly right."
7746:
  text: |-
    And there wasn't a flicker of light anywhere else, either, because all the other
    first-years who were supposed to be practicing their Patronus Charms had been
    glancing out of the corners of their eyes at Harry instead.
7747:
  text: |-
    The tears were threatening to come back into Harry's eyes, and they weren't
    happy tears. Of all the things, of all the things, Harry had never expected
    this.
7748:
  text: |-
    There was something horribly humiliating about being informed that you weren't
    happy enough.
7749:
  text: |-
    What did Anthony Goldstein have inside him that Harry didn't, that made
    Anthony's wand shine with that bright light?
7750:
  text: |-
    Did Anthony love his own father more?
7751:
  text: |-
    "What thought were you using to cast it?" said Remus.
7752:
  text: |-
    "My father," Harry said, his voice trembling. "I asked him to buy me some books
    before I came to Hogwarts, and he did, and they were expensive, and then he
    asked me if they were enough -"
7753:
  text: |-
    Harry didn't try to explain about the Verres family motto.
7754:
  text: |-
    "Take a rest before you try a different thought, Harry," said Remus. He gestured
    toward where some other students were sitting on the ground, looking
    disappointed or embarrassed or regretful. "You won't be able to cast a Patronus
    Charm while you're feeling ashamed of not being grateful enough." There was a
    gentle compassion in Mr. Lupin's voice, and for a moment, Harry felt like
    hitting something.
7755:
  text: |-
    Instead Harry turned around, and stalked to where the other failures were
    sitting. The other students whose wandwork had also been proclaimed perfect, and
    who were now supposed to be searching for happier thoughts; by the looks of them
    they weren't making much progress. There were many robes there trimmed in dark
    blue, and a handful of red, and one lone Hufflepuff girl who was still crying.
    The Slytherins hadn't even bothered showing up, except for Daphne Greengrass and
    Tracey Davis, who were still trying to get the gestures.
7756:
  text: |-
    Harry plopped down on the cold dead grass of winter, next to the student whose
    failure had surprised him the most.
7757:
  text: |-
    "So you couldn't do it either," Hermione said. She'd fled the field at first,
    but she'd come back after that, and you had to look closely at her reddened eyes
    to see that she'd been crying.
7758:
  text: |-
    "I," Harry said, "I, I'd probably feel a lot worse about that if you hadn't
    failed, you're the nicest, person I know, that I've ever met, Hermione, and if
    <em>you</em> also can't do it, it means I might still be, be good..."
7759:
  text: |-
    "I should have gone to Gryffindor," Hermione whispered. She blinked hard a few
    times, but she didn't wipe her eyes.
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
7760:
  text: |-
    The boy and the girl walked forward together, definitely not holding hands, but
    each drawing a kind of strength from the other's presence, something that let
    them ignore the whispers of their year-mates, as they walked through the hallway
    approaching the great doors of Hogwarts.
7761:
  text: |-
    Harry hadn't been able to cast the Patronus Charm no matter what happy thought
    he tried. People hadn't seemed surprised by that, which made it even worse.
    Hermione hadn't been able to do it either. People had been <em>very</em>
    surprised by that, and Harry had seen her starting to get the same sidelong
    looks as him. The other Ravenclaws who'd failed weren't getting those looks. But
    Hermione was the Sunshine General, and her fans were treating it like she'd
    failed them, somehow, like she'd betrayed a promise she'd never made.
7762:
  text: |-
    The two of them had gone to the library to research the Patronus Charm, which
    was Hermione's way of dealing with distress, as it was sometimes also Harry's.
    Study, learn, try to understand <em>why...</em>
7763:
  text: |-
    The books had confirmed what the Headmaster had told Harry; often, wizards who
    couldn't cast the Patronus Charm in practice would be able to do so in the
    presence of a real Dementor, going from flat failure all the way to a full
    corporeal Patronus. It defied all logic, the Dementor's aura of fear ought to
    make it <em>harder</em> to wield a happy thought; but that was the way it was.
7764:
  text: |-
    So the two of them were both going to give it one last try, there was no way
    either of them wouldn't give it one last try.
7765:
  text: |-
    It was the day the Dementor came to Hogwarts.
7766:
  text: |-
    Earlier, Harry had unTransfigured his father's rock from where it usually rested
    on his pinky ring in the form of a tiny diamond, and placed the huge gray stone
    back into his pouch. Just in case Harry's magic failed entirely, when he
    confronted the darkest of all creatures.
7767:
  text: |-
    Harry had already started to feel pessimistic, and he wasn't even in front of a
    Dementor yet.
7768:
  text: |-
    "I bet you can do it and I can't," Harry said in a whisper. "I bet that's what
    happens."
7769:
  text: |-
    "It felt wrong to me," Hermione said, her voice even quieter than his. "I tried
    it this morning and I realized. When I was doing the brandish at the end, even
    before I said the words, it felt wrong."
7770:
  text: |-
    Harry didn't say anything. He'd felt the same thing, right from the start,
    though it had taken another five attempts using five other happy thoughts before
    he'd been able to acknowledge it to himself. Every time he tried to brandish his
    wand, it had felt hollow; the spell he was trying to learn didn't fit him.
7771:
  text: |-
    "It doesn't mean we're going to be Dark Wizards," said Harry. "Lots of people
    who can't cast the Patronus Charm aren't Dark Wizards. Godric Gryffindor wasn't
    a Dark Wizard..."
7772:
  text: |-
    Godric had defeated Dark Lords, fought to protect commoners from Noble Houses
    and Muggles from wizards. He'd had many fine friends and true, and lost no more
    than half of them in one good cause or another. He'd listened to the screams of
    the wounded, in the armies he'd raised to defend the innocent; young wizards of
    courage had rallied to his calls, and he'd buried them afterward. Until finally,
    when his wizardry had only just begun to fail him in his old age, he'd brought
    together the three other most powerful wizards of his era to raise Hogwarts from
    the bare ground; the one great accomplishment to Godric's name that wasn't about
    war, any kind of war, no matter how just. It was Salazar, and not Godric, who'd
    taught the first Hogwarts class in Battle Magic. Godric had taught the first
    Hogwarts class in Herbology, the magics of green growing life.
7773:
  text: |-
    To his last day he'd never been able to cast the Patronus Charm.
7774:
  text: |-
    Godric Gryffindor had been a good man, not a happy one.
7775:
  text: |-
    Harry didn't believe in angst, he couldn't stand reading about whiny heroes, he
    knew a billion other people in the world would have given anything to trade
    places with him, and...
7776:
  text: |-
    And on his deathbed, Godric had told Helga (for Salazar had abandoned him, and
    Rowena passed before) that he didn't regret any of it, and he was <em>not</em>
    warning his students not to follow in his footsteps, no one was <em>ever</em> to
    say he'd told anyone not to follow in his footsteps. If it had been the right
    thing for <em>him</em> to do, then he wouldn't tell anyone else to choose
    wrongly, not even the youngest student in Hogwarts. And yet for those who
    <em>did</em> follow in his footsteps, he hoped they would remember that
    Gryffindor had told his House that it was all right for them to be happier than
    him. That red and gold would be bright warm colors, from now on.
7777:
  text: |-
    And Helga had promised him, weeping, that when she was Headmistress she would
    make sure of it.
7778:
  text: |-
    Whereupon Godric had died, and left no ghost behind him; and Harry had shoved
    the book back to Hermione and walked away a little, so she wouldn't see him
    crying.
7779:
  text: |-
    You wouldn't think that a book with an innocent title like "The Patronus Charm:
    Wizards Who Could and Couldn't" would be the saddest book Harry had ever read.
7780:
  text: |-
    Harry...
7781:
  text: |-
    Harry didn't want that.
7782:
  text: |-
    To be in that book.
7783:
  text: |-
    Harry didn't want that.
7784:
  text: |-
    The rest of the school just seemed to think that <em>No Patronus</em> meant
    <em>Bad Person,</em> plain and simple. Somehow the fact that Godric Gryffindor
    also hadn't been able to cast the Patronus Charm seemed not to get repeated.
    Maybe people didn't talk about it to respect his last wish, Fred and George
    probably didn't know and Harry certainly wasn't about to tell them. Or maybe the
    other failures didn't mention it because it was less shameful, the smaller loss
    of pride and status, to be thought Dark rather than unhappy.
7785:
  text: |-
    Harry saw that Hermione, beside him, was blinking hard; and he wondered if she
    was thinking of Rowena Ravenclaw, who'd also loved books.
7786:
  text: |-
    "Okay," Harry whispered. "Happier thoughts. If you do go to a full corporeal
    Patronus, what do you think your animal will be?"
7787:
  text: |-
    "An otter," Hermione said at once.
7788:
  text: |-
    "An <em>otter?</em> " Harry whispered incredulously.
7789:
  text: |-
    "Yes, an otter," said Hermione. "What about yours?"
7790:
  text: |-
    "Peregrine falcon," Harry said without hesitation. "It can dive faster than
    three hundred kilometers per hour, it's the fastest living creature there is."
    The peregrine falcon had been Harry's favorite animal since forever. Harry was
    determined to become an Animagus someday, just to get that as his form, and fly
    by the strength of his own wings, and see the land below with sharper eyes...
    "But why an <em>otter?</em> "
7791:
  text: |-
    Hermione smiled, but didn't say anything.
7792:
  text: |-
    And the vast doors of Hogwarts swung open.
7793:
  text: |-
    They walked for a time, the children, over a pathway that led toward the
    unforbidden forest, and continued through the forest itself. The Sun was
    lowering to near the horizon, the shadows long, the sunlight filtered through
    the bare branches of the winter trees; for it was January, and the first-years
    the last to learn, that day.
7794:
  text: |-
    Then the path swerved and took a new direction, and they all saw it in the
    distance, the clearing in the forest, and the sere winter grounds, yellowing
    dried grass whitened by a few small remnants of snow.
7795:
  text: |-
    The human figures still small at that range. The two spots of dim white light
    from the Aurors' Patronuses, and the brighter spot of silver light from the
    Headmaster's, next to something...
7796:
  text: |-
    Harry squinted.
7797:
  text: |-
    Something...
7798:
  text: |-
    It must have been purely Harry's imagination, because there shouldn't have been
    any way for a Dementor to reach past three corporeal Patronuses, but he thought
    he could feel a touch of emptiness brushing at his mind, brushing straight at
    the soft inner center of himself without any respect for Occlumency barriers.
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
7799:
  text: |-
    Seamus Finnigan was ashen and trembling as he rejoined the students milling
    about on the withered and snow-spotted grass. Seamus's Patronus Charm had been
    successful, but there was still that interval between when the Headmaster
    dispelled his own Patronus and when you were supposed to cast your own, when you
    faced the Dementor's fear unshielded.
7800:
  text: |-
    Up to twenty seconds of exposure at five paces was certainly safe, even for an
    eleven-year-old wizard with weak resistance and a still-maturing brain. There
    was a lot of variance in how hard the Dementor's power hit people, which was
    another thing not quite understood; but twenty seconds was definitely safe.
7801:
  text: |-
    Forty seconds of Dementor exposure at five paces might <em>possibly</em> have
    been enough to cause permanent damage, though only to the most sensitive
    subjects.
7802:
  text: |-
    It was harsh training even by the standards of Hogwarts, where the way you
    learned to fly on a hippogriff was by being tossed on one and told to get going.
    Harry was no fan of overprotectiveness, and if you looked at the difference in
    maturity between a fourth-year in Hogwarts and a fourteen-year-old Muggle, it
    was clear that Muggles were smothering their children... but even Harry had
    started to wonder if this was pushing it. Not every hurt could be healed
    afterward.
7803:
  text: |-
    But if you couldn't cast the spell under those conditions, it meant you couldn't
    rely on using the Patronus Charm to defend yourself; overconfidence was even
    more dangerous to wizards than to Muggles. Dementors could drain your magic and
    your physical vitality, not just your happy thoughts, which meant you might
    <em>not</em> be able to Apparate away if you waited too long, or if you didn't
    recognize the approaching fear until the Dementor was within range for its
    attack. (During his reading, Harry had discovered with considerable horror that
    some books claimed the Dementor's Kiss would <em>eat your soul</em> and that
    this was the reason for the permanent mindless coma into which it put the
    victims. And that wizards who <em>believed this</em> had deliberately used the
    Dementor's Kiss to <em>execute criminals.</em> It was a certainty that some
    called criminals were innocent, and even if they weren't, <em>destroying their
    souls?</em> If Harry had believed in souls, he would have... drawn a blank, he
    just couldn't think of an appropriate response to that.)
7804:
  text: |-
    The Headmaster was taking security seriously, and so were the three Aurors
    standing guard. Their leader was an Asianish-looking man, solemn without being
    grim, Auror Komodo, whose wand never left his hand. His Patronus, an orangutan
    of solid moonlight, paced back and forth between the Dementor and the first-
    years awaiting their turn; beside the orangutan moved the bright white panther
    of Auror Butnaru, a man with a piercing gaze, long black hair in a ponytail, and
    a long braided goatee. Those two Aurors, and their two Patronuses, were all
    watching the Dementor. On the opposite side of the students was the resting
    Auror Goryanof, tall and thin and pale and unshaven, sitting back on a chair
    he'd conjured without word or wand, and maintaining an absentminded pokerface as
    he scanned the entire scene. Professor Quirrell had shown up not long after the
    first-years began their attempts, and his eyes never strayed far from Harry. The
    tiny Professor Flitwick, who had been a champion duellist, was fiddling absently
    with his wand; and <em>his</em> eyes, peering out from within the huge puffy
    beard that served as his face, stayed focused on Professor Quirrell.
7805:
  text: |-
    And it must have been Harry's imagination, but Professor Quirrell seemed to
    wince slightly each time the Headmaster's Patronus winked out to test the next
    student. Maybe Professor Quirrell was imagining the same placebo effect as
    Harry, that backwash of emptiness caressing at his mind.
7806:
  text: |-
    "Anthony Goldstein," called the voice of the Headmaster.
7807:
  text: |-
    Harry quietly walked toward Seamus, even as Anthony began to approach the
    shining silver phoenix, and... whatever it was beneath the tattered cloak.
7808:
  text: |-
    "What did you see?" Harry asked Seamus in a low voice.
7809:
  text: |-
    A lot of students hadn't answered Harry, when he'd tried to gather the data; but
    Seamus was Finnigan of Chaos, one of Harry's lieutenants. Maybe that wasn't
    fair, but...
7810:
  text: |-
    "Dead," said Seamus in a whisper, "grayish and slimy... dead and left in water
    for a while... "
7811:
  text: |-
    Harry nodded. "That's what a lot of people see," Harry said. He projected
    confidence, even though it was fake, because Seamus needed it. "Go eat some
    chocolate, you'll feel better."
7812:
  text: |-
    Seamus nodded and stumbled off toward the table of healing sweets.
7813:
  text: |-
    "<em>Expecto Patronum!</em> " cried a young boy's voice.
7814:
  text: |-
    Then there were gasps of shock, even from the Aurors.
7815:
  text: |-
    Harry spun around to look -
7816:
  text: |-
    There was a brilliant silver bird standing between Anthony Goldstein and the
    cage. The bird reared its head and let out a cry, and the cry was also silver,
    as bright and hard and beautiful as metal.
7817:
  text: |-
    And something in the back of Harry's mind said, <em>if that's a peregrine
    falcon, I'm going to strangle him in his sleep.</em>
7818:
  text: |-
    <em>Shut up,</em> Harry said to the thought, <em>do you want us to be a Dark
    Wizard?</em>
7819:
  text: |-
    <em>What's the point? You're going to end up as one eventually.</em>
7820:
  text: |-
    That... wasn't something Harry would usually have thought...
7821:
  text: |-
    <em>It's a placebo effect,</em> Harry told himself again. <em>The Dementor can't
    actually get to me through three corporeal Patronuses, I'm just imagining what I
    think it's like. When I actually face the Dementor, it'll feel completely
    different, and then I'll know I was just being silly before.</em>
7822:
  text: |-
    A slight chill went down Harry's spine then, because he had a feeling that yes,
    it <em>would</em> be completely different, and not in a positive direction.
7823:
  text: |-
    The blazing silver phoenix sprang back into existence from the Headmaster's
    wand, the lesser bird vanished; and Anthony Goldstein began to walk back.
7824:
  text: |-
    The Headmaster was coming with Anthony instead of calling out the next name, the
    Patronus waiting behind to guard the Dementor.
7825:
  text: |-
    Harry glanced over to where Hermione was standing, just behind the glowing
    panther. Hermione's turn would have come next, but had apparently just been
    delayed.
7826:
  text: |-
    She looked stressed.
7827:
  text: |-
    Earlier, she'd politely asked Harry to please stop trying to destress her.
7828:
  text: |-
    Dumbledore was smiling slightly as he escorted Anthony back toward the others;
    smiling only slightly, because the Headmaster looked very, very tired.
7829:
  text: |-
    "Unbelievable," said Dumbledore in a voice that sounded much weaker than his
    accustomed boom. "A corporeal Patronus, in his first year. And an astounding
    number of successes among the other young students. Quirinus, I must acknowledge
    that you have proved your point."
7830:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell inclined his head. "A simple enough guess, I should think. A
    Dementor attacks through fear, and children are less afraid."
7831:
  text: |-
    "<em>Less</em> afraid?" said Auror Goryanof from where he was sitting.
7832:
  text: |-
    "So I said as well," said Dumbledore. "And Professor Quirrell pointed out that
    adults had more courage, not less to fear; which thought, I confess, had never
    occurred to me before."
7833:
  text: |-
    "That was not my <em>precise</em> phrasing," Professor Quirrell said dryly, "but
    it will do. And the rest of our agreement, Headmaster?"
7834:
  text: |-
    "As you say," Dumbledore said reluctantly. "I admit I was not expecting to lose
    that wager, Quirinus, but you have proven your wisdom."
7835:
  text: |-
    All the students were looking at them, puzzled; except Hermione, who was staring
    in the direction of the cage and the tall decaying robes; and Harry, who was
    watching everyone, since he was imagining himself feeling paranoid.
7836:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell said, in tones that did not invite further comments, "I am
    allowed to teach the Killing Curse to students who wish to learn it. Which will
    render them considerably safer from Dark Wizards and other pests, and it is
    foolish to think they will otherwise know no deadly magics." Professor Quirrell
    paused, his eyes narrowing. "Headmaster, I respectfully observe that you are not
    looking well. I suggest leaving the remainder of the day's task to Professor
    Flitwick."
7837:
  text: |-
    Dumbledore shook his head. "We are almost done for the day, Quirinus. I will
    last."
7838:
  text: |-
    Hermione had approached Anthony. "Captain Goldstein," she said, and her voice
    trembled only a little, "can you give me any advice?"
7839:
  text: |-
    "Don't be afraid," Anthony said firmly. "Don't think about anything it tries to
    make you think about. You're not just holding up the wand in front of you as a
    shield against the fear, you're <em>brandishing</em> your wand to drive the fear
    away, that's how you make a happy thought into something solid..." Anthony
    shrugged helplessly. "I mean, I <em>heard</em> all that before, but..."
7840:
  text: |-
    Other students were starting to congregate around Anthony, with their own
    questions.
7841:
  text: |-
    "Miss Granger?" the Headmaster said. His voice might have been gentle, or just
    weakened.
7842:

    Hermione straightened her shoulders, and followed him.

    "What did you see under the cloak?" Harry said to Anthony.
7844:
  text: |-
    Anthony looked at Harry, surprised, and then answered, "A very tall man who was
    dead, I mean, sort of dead-shaped and dead-colored... it hurt to see him and I
    knew that was the Dementor trying to get at me."
7845:

    Harry looked back out at where Hermione was confronting the cage and the cloak.
7846:
  text: |-
    Hermione raised her wand into position for the first gestures.
7847:
  text: |-
    The Headmaster's phoenix winked out of existence.
7848:
  text: |-
    And Hermione gave a tiny, pathetic shriek, flinched -
7849:
  text: |-
    - took a step back, Harry could see her wand moving, and then she brandished it
    and said "Expecto Patronum!"
7850:
  text: |-
    Nothing happened.
7851:
  text: |-
    Hermione turned and ran.
7852:
  text: |-
    "<em>Expecto Patronum!</em> " said the Headmaster's deeper voice, and the silver
    phoenix blazed back to life.
7853:
  text: |-
    The young girl stumbled, and kept running, strange sounds beginning to come from
    her throat.
7854:
  text: |-
    "<em>Hermione!</em> " Susan yelled it, and Hannah, and Daphne, and Ernie, and
    they all started to run toward her; even as Harry, who was always thinking one
    step ahead, spun on his own heel and ran for the table with the chocolate.
7855:
  text: |-
    Even after Harry had shoved the chocolate into Hermione's mouth and she'd chewed
    and swallowed, she was still breathing in great gasps and crying, her eyes still
    seemed unfocused.
7856:
  text: |-
    <em>She can't have been permanently Demented,</em> Harry thought desperately at
    the confusion inside him, the horrible fear and deathly fury beginning to twist
    around each other, <em>she can't have been, she wasn't exposed for even ten
    seconds let alone forty -</em>
7857:
  text: |-
    But she could be <em>temporarily</em> Demented, as Harry realized in that
    moment, there wasn't any rule that you couldn't be <em>temporarily</em> injured
    by a Dementor in just ten seconds if you were sensitive enough.
7858:
  text: |-
    Then Hermione's eyes seemed to focus, and dart around, and settle on him.
7859:
  text: |-
    "Harry," she gasped, and the other students went silent. "Harry, don't.
    <em>Don't!</em> "
7860:
  text: |-
    Harry was suddenly afraid to ask what he shouldn't do, was <em>he</em> in her
    worst memories, or some sleep's nightmare that she was now reliving in waking
    life?
7861:
  text: |-
    "<em>Don't go near it!"</em> said Hermione. Her hand reached out, grabbed him by
    the lapel of his robes. "You mustn't go near it, Harry! <em>It spoke to me,
    Harry, it knows you, it knows you're here!</em> "
7862:
  text: |-
    "What -" Harry said, and then cursed himself for asking.
7863:
  text: |-
    "<em>The Dementor!</em> " said Hermione. Her voice rose to a shriek.
    "<em>Professor Quirrell wants it to eat you!</em> "

        I was broadly modeling the Dementor on having picked up something like a
        suggestion or a hint of the Defense Professor's plans, and transmitted
        something like a suggestion or hint of that to Hermione, though in very vague
        detail and with elaboration by fear. Dementors affect and are affected by the
        people around them.

    In the sudden hush, Professor Quirrell came forward a few steps; but he didn't
    approach any closer (Harry was there, after all). "Miss Granger," he said, and
    his voice was grave, "I think you should have some more chocolate."
7865:
  text: |-
    "<em>Professor Flitwick, don't let Harry try, send him back!</em> "
7866:

    The Headmaster had arrived by then, and he and Professor Flitwick were
    exchanging worried looks.
7867:
  text: |-
    "I did not hear the Dementor speak," the Headmaster said. "Still..."
7868:
  text: |-
    "Just ask," said Professor Quirrell, sounding a little weary.
7869:
  text: |-
    "Did the Dementor say <em>how</em> it would get to Harry?" said the Headmaster.
7870:
  text: |-
    "All his tastiest parts first," said Hermione, "it would - it would eat -"
7871:
  text: |-
    Hermione blinked. Some sanity seemed to come back into her eyes.
7872:
  text: |-
    Then she started crying.
7873:
  text: |-
    "You were too brave, Hermione Granger," the Headmaster said. His voice was
    gentle, and clearly audible. "Too much braver than I comprehended. You should
    have turned and run, not endured and tried to complete your Charm. When you are
    older and stronger, Miss Granger, I know that you will try again, and I know
    that you will succeed."
7874:
  text: |-
    "I'm sorry," Hermione said in gasps, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry... I'm
    sorry, Harry, I can't tell you what I saw, I didn't look at it, I didn't dare
    look at it, I knew it was too horrible to ever be seen..."
7875:
  text: |-
    It should have been Harry, but he'd hesitated, because his hands were all
    chocolatey; and then Ernie and Susan were there, helping Hermione from where
    she'd fallen on the grass, leading her toward the snacks table.
7876:
  text: |-
    Five bars of chocolate later, Hermione seemed to be all right again, and she
    went over and apologized to Professor Quirrell; but she was always watching
    Harry, every time that he glanced in her direction. He'd stepped toward her only
    once, and stopped when she'd stepped away. Her eyes had silently apologized, and
    silently pleaded for him to leave her be.

    Neville Longbottom had seen something dead and half-dissolved, oozing and
    running with a face like a squashed sponge.
7878:
  text: |-
    It was the worst thing anyone had yet described seeing. Neville had been able to
    produce a small flicker of light from his wand before, but he had, intelligently
    and with great presence of mind, turned and run away instead of trying to cast
    his own Patronus Charm.
7879:
  text: |-
    (The Headmaster had said nothing to the other students, told no one else to be
    less brave; but Professor Quirrell had calmly observed that if you made the
    mistake <em>after</em> being warned, that was when ignorance became stupidity.)
7880:
  text: |-
    "Professor Quirrell?" Harry said in a low voice, having come as close to the
    Defense Professor as he dared. "What do <em>you</em> see when you -"
7881:
  text: |-
    "Don't ask." The voice was very flat.
7882:
  text: |-
    Harry nodded respectfully. "What was your <em>original</em> phrasing to the
    Headmaster, if I can ask?"
7883:
  text: |-
    Dryly. "Our worst memories can only grow worse as we grow older."
7884:
  text: |-
    "Ah," Harry said. "Logical."
7885:
  text: |-
    Something strange flickered in Professor Quirrell's eyes, then, as he looked at
    Harry. "Let us hope," Professor Quirrell said, "that you succeed upon this try,
    Mr. Potter. For if you do, the Headmaster may teach you his trick of using a
    Patronus to send messages that cannot be forged or intercepted, and the military
    importance of that is impossible to overstate. It would be a tremendous
    advantage to the Chaos Legion, and someday, I suspect, this entire country. But
    if you do <em>not</em> succeed, Mr. Potter... well, <em>I</em> shall
    understand."

    Morag MacDougal had said, in a wavering voice, "Ouch", and Dumbledore had recast

    Parvati Patil had produced a corporeal Patronus in the form of a tiger, larger
    than Dumbledore's phoenix, though not nearly as bright. There had been a great
    burst of applause from all the watchers, though not the same shock as when
    Anthony had done it.
7888:
  text: |-
    And then it was Harry's turn.
7889:
  text: |-
    The Headmaster called the name of Harry Potter, and Harry was afraid.
7890:
  text: |-
    Harry knew, he knew that he was going to fail, and he knew that it was going to
    hurt.
7891:
  text: |-
    But he still had to try; because sometimes, in the presence of a Dementor, a
    wizard went from not a flicker of light to a full corporeal Patronus, and no one
    understood why.
7892:
  text: |-
    And because if Harry <em>couldn't</em> defend himself from Dementors, he had to
    be able to recognize their approach, recognize the feeling of them in his mind,
    and run before it was too late.
7893:
  text: |-
    <em>What is my worst memory...?</em>
7894:
  text: |-
    Harry had expected the Headmaster to give him a worried look, or a hopeful look,
    or deeply wise advice; but instead Albus Dumbledore only watched him with quiet
    calm.
7895:
  text: |-
    <em>He thinks I'm going to fail, but he won't sabotage me by telling me so,</em>

    The cage came closer. It was already tarnished, but not rusted away to nothing,
    not yet.
7897:
  text: |-
    The cloak came closer. It was unraveling and shot through with unpatched holes;
    it had been new that morning, Auror Goryanof had said.
7898:
  text: |-
    "Headmaster?" Harry said. "What do you see?"
7899:
  text: |-
    The Headmaster's voice was also calm. "The Dementors are creatures of fear, and
    as your fear of the Dementor diminishes, so does the fearsomeness of its form. I
    see a tall, thin, naked man. He is not decaying. He is only slightly painful to
    look upon. That is all. What do you see, Harry?"
7900:
  text: |-
    ...Harry couldn't see under the cloak.
7901:
  text: |-
    Or that wasn't right, it was that his mind was <em>refusing</em> to see what was
    under the cloak...
7902:
  text: |-
    No, his mind was trying to see the <em>wrong</em> thing under the cloak, Harry
    could feel it, his eyes trying to force a mistake. But Harry had done his best
    to train himself to notice that tiny feeling of confusion, to automatically
    flinch away from making stuff up; and every time his mind tried to start
    inventing a lie about what was under the cloak, that reflex was fast enough to
    shut it down.
7903:
  text: |-
    Harry looked under the cloak and saw...
7904:
  text: |-
    An open question. Harry wouldn't let his mind see something false, and so he
    didn't see anything, like the part of his visual cortex getting that signal was
    just ceasing to exist. There was a blind spot under the cloak. Harry couldn't
    know what was under there.

        Something no one else has mentioned in a particularly clear way, though AdShea
        did mention Harry's "brain-hypervisor", is that Harry can't hear the dementors
        for the same reason that he can't see them. The dementors are "trying" (for
        lack of a better term) to convince the people around them that they're "dead
        things left in water", but they aren't really that. And Harry's training to
        avoid accepting falsehoods prevents him from being affected by that part of
        the dementors' magical effect.

    The unseeable horror beneath the cloak was very close, now, but the blazing bird
    of moonlight, the white phoenix, yet lay between them.
7907:
  text: |-
    Harry wanted to run away like some of the other students had. Half the ones
    who'd had no luck with their Patronus Charms just hadn't shown up today in the
    first place. Of those remaining, half had fled before the Headmaster had even
    dispelled his own Patronus, and no one had said a word. There'd been a little
    laughter when Terry had turned and walked back before his own try; and Susan and
    Hannah, who'd gone before, had yelled at everyone to shut up.
7908:
  text: |-
    But Harry was the Boy-Who-Lived, and he would lose much respect if he was seen
    to give up without even trying...
7909:
  text: |-
    Pride and roles seemed to diminish and fall away, in the presence of whatever
    lay beneath the cloak.
7910:
  text: |-
    <em>Why am I still here?</em>
7911:
  text: |-
    It wasn't the shame of others thinking him cowardly, that kept Harry's feet in
    place.
7912:
  text: |-
    It wasn't the hope of repairing his reputation that brought up his wand.
7913:
  text: |-
    It wasn't the desire to master the Patronus Charm as magic, that moved his
    fingers into the initial position.
7914:
  text: |-
    It was something else, something that <em>had</em> to oppose whatever lay
    beneath the cloak, this was the true darkness and Harry had to find out whether
    it lay within him, the power to drive it back.
7915:
  text: |-
    Harry had planned to try one final time to think of his book-shopping spree with
    his father, but instead, at the last minute, facing the Dementor, a different
    memory occurred to him, something he hadn't tried before; a thought that wasn't
    warm and happy in the ordinary way, but felt righter, somehow.
7916:
  text: |-
    And Harry remembered the stars, remembered them burning terribly bright and
    unwavering in the Silent Night; he let that image fill him, fill all of him like
    an Occlumency barrier across his entire mind, became once again the bodiless
    awareness of the void.
7917:
  text: |-
    The bright silver shining phoenix vanished.
7918:
  text: |-
    And the Dementor smashed into his mind like the fist of God.
7919:
  text: |-
    <strong>FEAR / COLD / DARKNESS</strong>
7920:
  text: |-
    There was an instant when the two forces clashed head-on, when the peaceful
    starlit memory held its own against the fear, even as Harry's fingers began the
    wand motions, practiced until they had become automatic. They weren't warm and
    happy, those blazing points of light in perfect blackness; but it was an image
    the Dementor could not easily pierce. For the silent burning stars were vast and
    unafraid, and to shine in the cold and darkness was their natural state.
7921:
  text: |-
    But there was a flaw, a crack, a fault-line in the immovable object trying to
    resist that irresistible force. Harry felt a twinge of anger at the Dementor for
    trying to feed on him, and it was like slipping on wet ice. Harry's mind began
    to slide sideways, into bitterness, black fury, deathly hatred -
7922:
  text: |-
    Harry's wand came up in the final brandish.
7923:
  text: |-
    It felt wrong.
7924:
  text: |-
    "Expecto Patronum," his voice spoke, the words hollow and pointless.
7925:
  text: |-
    And Harry fell into his dark side, fell down into his dark side, further and
    faster and deeper than ever before, down down down as the slide accelerated, as
    the Dementor latched onto the exposed and vulnerable parts and fed on them,
    eating away the light. A fading reflex scrabbled for warmth, but even as an
    image of Hermione came to him, or an image of Mum and Dad, the Dementor twisted
    it, showed him Hermione lying dead on the ground, the corpses of his mother and
    father, and then even that was sucked away.
7926:
  text: |-
    Into the vacuum rose the memory, the worst memory, something forgotten so long
    ago that the neural patterns shouldn't have still existed.
7927:

    <em>"Lily, take Harry and go! It's him!" shouted a man's voice. "Go! Run! I'll

    <em>Then the other voice spoke, high-pitched like the hiss of a teakettle, and

    said:</em>

    <em>"Avadakedavra."</em>

    Charm.)

    <em>"Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry!" screamed the woman's voice.</em>

    and screamed at the Dementor, and Dean Thomas roared the words like they had
    been written in letters of fire and his wand gave birth to a towering white
    bear; there were eight blazing Patronuses all in a line between Harry and the

    couldn't remember why she had thought it was possible, why she had been afraid -

    Hermione realized then what she ought to do, and it was the hardest decision of
    her life.

    All her limbs cold as death, her vision gone dark, fear overwhelming everything;
    she'd seen Harry dying, Mum and Dad dying, all her friends dying, everyone
    dying, so that in the end, when she died, she would be alone. That was her
    secret nightmare she'd never talked about with anyone, that had given the
    Dementor its power over her, the loneliest thing was to die alone.

    "Miss Granger!" squeaked Professor Flitwick, but he made no move to stop her,
    only kept holding his wand on Professor Quirrell.

    "<em>Everyone!</em> " shouted Auror Komodo in a voice of military command.
    "<em>Get your Patronuses out of her way!</em> "

    "<em>FLITWICK!</em> " roared Professor Quirrell. "<em>SUMMON POTTER'S
    WAND!</em> "

    Even as Hermione understood, Professor Flitwick was already crying
    "<em>Accio!</em> ", and she saw the stick of wood zooming up from where it had
    lain almost touching the Dementor's cage.
