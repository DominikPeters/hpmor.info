    As soon as he walked into the Defence classroom on Wednesday, Harry knew that
    <em>this</em> subject was going to be <em>different</em>.
2205:
  text: |-
    It was, for a start, the largest classroom he had yet seen at Hogwarts, akin to
    a major university classroom, with layered tiers of desks facing a gigantic flat
    stage of white marble. The classroom was high up in the castle - on the fifth
    floor - and Harry knew that was as much explanation as he'd get for where a room
    like this was supposed to fit. It was becoming clear that Hogwarts simply did
    not <em>have</em> a geometry, Euclidean or otherwise; it had connections, not
    directions.
2206:
  text: |-
    Unlike a university hall, there weren't rows of folding seats; instead there
    were quite ordinary Hogwarts wooden desks and wooden chairs, lined up in a curve
    across each level of the classroom. Except that each desk had a flat, white,
    rectangular, mysterious object propped up on it.
2207:
  text: |-
    In the center of the gigantic platform, on a small raised dais of darker marble,
    was a lone teacher's desk. At which Quirrell sat slumped over in his chair, head
    lolled back, drooling slightly over his robes.
2208:
  text: |-
    <em>Now what does that remind me of...?</em>
2209:
  text: |-
    Harry had arrived at the lesson so early that no other students were there yet.
    (The English language was defective when it came to describing time travel; in
    particular, English lacked any words capable of expressing how convenient it
    was.) Quirrell didn't seem to be... functional... at the moment, and Harry
    didn't particularly feel like approaching Quirrell anyway.
2210:
  text: |-
    Harry selected a desk, climbed up to it, sat down, and retrieved the Defence
    textbook. He was around seven-eighths of the way through - he'd planned on
    finishing the book before this lesson, actually, but he was running behind
    schedule and had already used the Time-Turner twice today.
2211:
  text: |-
    Soon there were sounds as the classroom began to fill up. Harry ignored them.
2212:
  text: |-
    "Potter? What are <em>you</em> doing here?"
2213:
  text: |-
    <em>That</em> voice didn't belong here. Harry looked up. "Draco? What are
    <em>you</em> doing in oh my god you have <em>minions</em>."
2214:
  text: |-
    One of the lads standing behind Draco seemed to have rather a lot of muscle for
    an eleven-year-old, and the other was poised in a suspiciously balanced-looking
    stance.
2215:
  text: |-
    The white-blonde-haired boy smiled rather smugly and gestured behind him.
    "Potter, I introduce to you Mr. Crabbe," his hand moved from Muscles to Balance,
    "Mr. Goyle. Vincent, Gregory, this is Harry Potter."
2216:
  text: |-
    Mr. Goyle tilted his head and gave Harry a look that was probably supposed to
    mean something but ended up just looking squinty. Mr. Crabbe said "Please to
    meetcha" in a tone that sounded like he was trying to lower his voice as far as
    it could go.
2217:
  text: |-
    A fleeting expression of consternation crossed Draco's face, but was quickly
    replaced by his superior grin.
2218:
  text: |-
    "You have <em>minions!</em> " Harry repeated. "Where do <em>I</em> get minions?"
2219:
  text: |-
    Draco's smirk grew wider. "I'm afraid, Potter, that the first step is to be
    Sorted into Slytherin -"
2220:
  text: |-
    "What? That's not fair!"
2221:
  text: |-
    "- and then for your families to have an arrangement from before you were born."
2222:
  text: |-
    Harry looked at Mr. Crabbe and Mr. Goyle. They both seemed to be trying very
    hard to loom. That is, they were leaning forwards, hunching over their
    shoulders, sticking their necks out and staring at him.
2223:
  text: |-
    "Um... hold on," said Harry. "This was arranged <em>years</em> ago?"
2224:
  text: |-
    "Exactly, Potter. I'm afraid you're out of luck."
2225:
  text: |-
    Mr. Goyle produced a toothpick and began cleaning his teeth, still looming.
2226:
  text: |-
    "And," said Harry, "Lucius insisted that you were <em>not</em> to grow up
    knowing your bodyguards, and that you were only to meet them on your first day
    of school."
2227:
  text: |-
    That wiped the grin from Draco's face. "Yes, Potter, we all know you're
    brilliant, the whole school knows by now, you can stop showing off -"
2228:
  text: |-
    "So they've been told their <em>whole lives</em> that they're going to be your
    minions and they've spent <em>years</em> imagining what minions are supposed to
    be like -"
2229:
  text: |-
    Draco winced.
2230:
  text: |-
    "- and what's worse, they <em>do</em> know <em>each other</em> and they've been
    <em>practising</em> -"
2231:
  text: |-
    "The boss told ya to shut it," rumbled Mr. Crabbe. Mr. Goyle bit down on his
    toothpick, holding it between his teeth, and used one hand to crack the knuckles
    on the other.
2232:
  text: |-
    <em>"I told you not to do this in front of Harry Potter!"</em>
2233:
  text: |-
    The two looked a bit sheepish and Mr. Goyle quickly put the toothpick back in a
    pocket of his robes.
2234:
  text: |-
    But the moment Draco turned away from them to face Harry again, they went back
    to looming.
2235:
  text: |-
    "I apologise," Draco said stiffly, "for the insult which these
    <em>imbeciles</em> have offered you."
2236:
  text: |-
    Harry gave a meaningful look to Mr. Crabbe and Mr. Goyle. "I'd say you're being
    a little harsh on them, Draco. <em>I</em> think they're acting exactly the way
    I'd want <em>my</em> minions to act. I mean, if I had any minions."
2237:
  text: |-
    Draco's jaw dropped.
2238:
  text: |-
    "Hey, Gregory, you don' think he's tryna lure us away from the boss, do ya?"
2239:
  text: |-
    "I'm sure Mr. Potter wouldn't be that foolish."
2240:
  text: |-
    "Oh, I wouldn't dream of it," Harry said smoothly. "It's just something to keep
    in mind if your current employer seems unappreciative. Besides, it never hurts
    to have other offers while you're negotiating your working conditions, right?"
2241:
  text: |-
    "What's <em>he</em> doin' in Ravenclaw?"
2242:
  text: |-
    "I can't imagine, Mr. Crabbe."
2243:
  text: |-
    "Both of you <em>shut up</em>," Draco said through gritted teeth. "That's an
    <em>order</em>." With a visible effort, he transferred his attention to Harry
    again. "Anyway, what're you doing in the Slytherin Defence class?"
2244:
  text: |-
    Harry frowned. "Hold on." His hand went into his pouch. "Timetable." He looked
    over the parchment. "Defence, 2:30pm, and right now it's..." Harry looked at his
    mechanical watch, which read 11:23. "2:23, unless I've lost track of time. Did
    I?" If he had, well, Harry knew how to get to whatever lesson he was
    <em>supposed</em> to be at. God he loved his Time-Turner and someday, when he
    was old enough, they would get married.
2245:
  text: |-
    "No, that sounds right," Draco said, looking puzzled. His gaze turned to look
    over the rest of the auditorium, which was filling with green-trimmed robes
    and...
2246:
  text: |-
    "<em>Gryffindorks!</em> " spat Draco. "What're <em>they</em> doing here?"
2247:
  text: |-
    "Hm," Harry said. "Professor Quirrell did say... I forget his exact words...
    that he would be ignoring some of the Hogwarts teaching conventions. Maybe he
    just combined all his classes."
2248:
  text: |-
    "Huh," said Draco. "You're the first Ravenclaw in here."
2249:
  text: |-
    "Yup. Got here early."
2250:
  text: |-
    "What're you doing all the way in the back row, then?"
2251:
  text: |-
    Harry blinked. "I dunno, seemed like a good place to sit?"
2252:
  text: |-
    Draco made a scoffing sound. "You couldn't get any further away from the teacher
    if you tried." The blonde-haired boy leaned slightly closer. "Anyway, is it true
    about what you said to Derrick and his crew?"
2253:
  text: |-
    "Who's Derrick?"
2254:
  text: |-
    "You hit him with a pie?"
2255:
  text: |-
    "Two pies, actually. What am I supposed to have said to him?"
2256:
  text: |-
    "That he wasn't doing anything cunning or ambitious and he was a disgrace to
    Salazar Slytherin." Draco was staring intently at Harry.
2257:
  text: |-
    "That... sounds about right," Harry said. "I think it was more like, 'is this
    some kind of incredibly clever plot that will gain you a future advantage or is
    it really as much of a disgrace to the memory of Salazar Slytherin as it looks
    like' or something like that. I don't remember the exact words."
2258:
  text: |-
    "You're confusing everyone, you know," said the blonde-haired boy.
2259:
  text: |-
    "Huh?" Harry said in honest confusion.
2260:
  text: |-
    "Warrington said that spending a long time under the Sorting Hat is one of the
    warning signs of a major Dark Wizard. Everyone was talking about it, wondering
    if they should start sucking up to you just in case. Then you went and protected
    a bunch of <em>Hufflepuffs,</em> for Merlin's sake. <em>Then</em> you told
    Derrick he's a disgrace to Salazar Slytherin's memory! What's anyone
    <em>supposed</em> to think?"
2261:
  text: |-
    "That the Sorting Hat decided to put me in the House of 'Slytherin! Just
    kidding! Ravenclaw!' and I've been acting accordingly."
2262:
  text: |-
    Mr. Crabbe and Mr. Goyle both giggled, causing Mr. Goyle to quickly clap a hand
    to his mouth.
2263:
  text: |-
    "We'd better go get our seats," Draco said. He hesitated, straightened a bit,
    spoke a bit more fomally. "But I do want to continue our last conversation and I
    accept your conditions."
2264:
  text: |-
    Harry nodded. "Would you mind terribly if I waited until Saturday afternoon? I'm
    in a bit of a contest right now."
2265:
  text: |-
    "A contest?"
2266:
  text: |-
    "See if I can read all my textbooks as fast as Hermione Granger did."
2267:
  text: |-
    "Granger," Draco echoed. His eyes narrowed. "The mudblood who thinks she's
    Merlin? If you're trying to show <em>her</em> up then all Slytherin wishes you
    the <em>very</em> best luck, Potter, and I won't bother you 'til Saturday."
    Draco inclined his head respectfully, and wandered off, tailed by his minions.
2268:
  text: |-
    <em>Oh, this is going to be</em> so <em>much fun to juggle, I can already
    tell.</em>
2269:
  text: |-
    The classroom was filling up rapidly now with all four colors of trim: green,
    red, yellow, and blue. Draco and his two friends seemed to be in the midst of
    trying to acquire three contiguous front-row seats - already occupied, of
    course. Mr. Crabbe and Mr. Goyle were looming vigorously, but it didn't seem to
    be having much effect.
2270:
  text: |-
    Harry bent over his Defence textbook and continued reading.
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
2271:
  text: |-
    At 2:35PM, when most of the seats were taken and no one else seemed to be coming
    in, Professor Quirrell gave a sudden jerk in his chair and sat up straight, and
    his face appeared on all the flat, white rectangular objects that were propped
    up on the students' desks.
2272:
  text: |-
    Harry was taken by surprise, both by the sudden appearance of Professor
    Quirrell's face and by the resemblance to Muggle television. There was something
    both nostalgic and sad about that, it seemed so much like a piece of home and
    yet it wasn't really...
2273:
  text: |-
    "Good afternoon, my young apprentices," said Professor Quirrell. His voice
    seemed to come from the desk screen and to be speaking directly to Harry.
    "Welcome to your first lesson in Battle Magic, as the founders of Hogwarts would
    have put it; or, as it happens to be called in the late twentieth century,
    Defence Against the Dark Arts."
2274:
  text: |-
    There was a certain amount of frantic scrabbling as students, taken by surprise,
    reached for their parchment or notebooks.
2275:
  text: |-
    "No," Professor Quirrell said. "Don't bother writing down what this subject was
    once called. No such pointless question will count toward your marks in any of
    my lessons. That is a promise."
2276:
  text: |-
    Many students sat straight up at that, looking rather shocked.
2277:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell was smiling thinly. "Those of you who have wasted time by
    reading your useless first-year Defence textbooks -"
2278:
  text: |-
    Someone made a choking sound. Harry wondered if it was Hermione.
2279:
  text: |-
    "- may have gotten the impression that although this subject is called Defence
    Against the Dark Arts, it is actually about how to defend against Nightmare
    Butterflies, which cause mildly bad dreams, or Acid Slugs, which can dissolve
    all the way through a two-inch wooden beam given most of a day."
2280:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell stood up, shoving his chair back from the desk. The screen on
    Harry's desk followed his every move. Professor Quirrell strode towards the
    front of the classroom, and bellowed:
2281:
  text: |-
    "The Hungarian Horntail is taller than a dozen men! It breathes fire so quickly
    and so accurately that it can melt a Snitch in midflight! One Killing Curse will
    bring it down!"
2282:
  text: |-
    There were gasps from the students.
2283:
  text: |-
    "The Mountain Troll is more dangerous than the Hungarian Horntail! It is strong
    enough to bite through steel! Its hide is resistant enough to withstand Stunning
    Hexes and Cutting Charms! Its sense of smell is so acute that it can tell from
    afar whether its prey is part of a pack, or alone and vulnerable! Most fearsome
    of all, the troll is unique among magical creatures in continuously maintaining
    a form of Transfiguration on itself - it is always transforming into its own
    body. If you somehow succeed in ripping off its arm it will grow another within
    seconds! Fire and acid will produce scar tissue which can temporarily confuse a
    troll's regenerative powers - for an hour or two! They are smart enough to use
    clubs as tools! The mountain troll is the third most perfect killing machine in
    all Nature! One Killing Curse will bring it down."
2284:
  text: |-
    The students were looking rather shocked.
2285:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell was smiling rather grimly. "Your sad excuse for a third-year
    Defence textbook will suggest to you that you expose the mountain troll to
    sunlight, which will freeze it in place. This, my young apprentices, is the sort
    of useless knowledge you will never find in my lessons. You do not encounter
    mountain trolls in open daylight! The idea that you should use sunlight to stop
    them is the result of foolish textbook authors trying to show off their mastery
    of minutia at the expense of practicality. Just because there is a ridiculously
    obscure way of dealing with mountain trolls does not mean you should actually
    try to use it! The Killing Curse is unblockable, unstoppable, and works every
    single time on anything with a brain. If, as an adult wizard, you find yourself
    incapable of using the Killing Curse, then you can simply Apparate away!
    Likewise if you are facing the second most perfect killing machine, a Dementor.
    You just Apparate away!"
2286:
  text: |-
    "Unless, of course," Professor Quirrell said, his voice now lower and harder,
    "you are under the influence of an anti-Apparition jinx. No, there is exactly
    one monster which can threaten you once you are fully grown. The single most
    dangerous monster in all the world, so dangerous that nothing else comes close.
    The Dark Wizard. That is the only thing that will still be able to threaten
    you."
2287:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell's lips were set in a thin line. "I will reluctantly teach you
    enough trivia for a passing mark on the Ministry-mandated portions of your
    first-year finals. Since your exact mark on these sections will make no
    difference to your future life, anyone who wants more than a passing mark is
    welcome to waste their own time studying our pathetic excuse for a textbook. The
    title of this subject is not Defence Against Minor Pests. You are here to learn
    how to defend yourselves against the Dark Arts. Which means, let us be very
    clear on this, defending yourselves against Dark Wizards. People with wands who
    want to hurt you and who will likely succeed in doing so unless you hurt them
    first! There is no defence without offence! There is no defence without
    fighting! This reality is deemed too harsh for eleven-year-olds by the fat,
    overpaid, Auror-guarded politicians who mandated your curriculum. To the abyss
    with those fools! You are here for the subject that has been taught at Hogwarts
    for eight hundred years! Welcome to your first year of Battle Magic!"
2288:
  text: |-
    Harry started applauding. He couldn't help himself, it was too inspiring.
2289:
  text: |-
    Once Harry started clapping there was some scattered response from Gryffindor,
    and more from Slytherin, but most students simply seemed too stunned to react.
2290:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell made a cutting gesture, and the applause died instantly.
    "Thank you very much," said Professor Quirrell. "Now to practicalities. I have
    combined all my first-year Battle classes into one, which allows me to offer you
    twice as much classroom time as Doubles sessions -"
2291:
  text: |-
    There were gasps of horror.
2292:
  text: |-
    "- an increased load which I will make up to you by not assigning any homework."
2293:
  text: |-
    The gasps of horror cut off abruptly.
2294:
  text: |-
    "Yes, you heard me correctly. I will teach you to fight, not to write twelve
    inches on fighting due Monday."
2295:
  text: |-
    Harry desperately wished he'd sat next to Hermione so he could see the look on
    her face now, but on the other hand he was pretty sure he was imagining it
    accurately.
2296:
  text: |-
    Also Harry was in love. It would be a three-way wedding: him, the Time-Turner,
    and Professor Quirrell.
2297:
  text: |-
    "For those of you who so choose, I have arranged some after-school activities
    that I think you will find quite interesting as well as educational. Do you want
    to show the world your <em>own</em> abilities instead of watching fourteen other
    people play Quidditch? More than seven people can fight in an army."
2298:
  text: |-
    Hot <em>damn.</em>
2299:
  text: |-
    "These and other after-school activities will also earn you Quirrell points.
    What are Quirrell points, you ask? The House point system does not suit my
    needs, because it makes House points too rare. I prefer to let my students know
    how they are doing more frequently than that. And on the rare occasions I offer
    you a written test, it will mark itself as you go along, and if you get too many
    related questions wrong, your test will show the names of students who got those
    questions right, and those students will be able to earn Quirrell points by
    helping you."
2300:
  text: |-
    ...wow. Why didn't the other professors use a system like that?
2301:
  text: |-
    "What good are Quirrell points, you wonder? For a start, ten Quirrell points
    will be worth one House point. But they will earn you other favors as well.
    Would you like to take your exam at an unusual time? Is there a particular
    session you would very much prefer to skip? You will find that I can be very
    flexible on behalf of students who have accumulated enough Quirrell points.
    Quirrell points will control the generalship of the armies. And for Christmas -
    just before the Christmas break - I will grant someone a wish. Any school-
    related feat that lies within my power, my influence, or above all, my
    ingenuity. Yes, I was in Slytherin and I am offering to formulate a cunning plot
    on your behalf, if that is what it takes to accomplish your desire. This wish
    will go to whoever has earned the most Quirrell points within all seven years."
2302:
  text: |-
    That would be Harry.
2303:
  text: |-
    "Now leave your books and loose items at your desks - they will be safe, the
    screens will watch over them for you - and come down onto this platform. It's
    time to play a game called Who's the Most Dangerous Student in the Classroom."
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
2304:
  text: |-
    Harry twisted his wand in his right hand and said "<em>Ma-ha-su!</em> "
2305:
  text: |-
    There was another high-pitched "bing" from the floating blue sphere that
    Professor Quirrell had assigned to Harry as his target. That particular sound
    meant a perfect strike, which Harry had been gotten on nine out of his last ten
    attempts.
2306:
  text: |-
    Somewhere Professor Quirrell had dug up a spell that was incredibly easy to
    pronounce, <em>and</em> had a ridiculously simple wand motion, <em>and</em> had
    a tendency to hit wherever you were currently looking at. Professor Quirrell had
    disdainfully proclaimed that real battle magic was far more difficult than this.
    That the hex was entirely useless in actual combat. That it was a barely ordered
    burst of magic whose only real content was the aiming, and that it would
    produce, when it hit, a pain briefly equivalent to being punched hard in the
    nose. That the sole purpose of this test was to see who was a fast learner,
    since Professor Quirrell was certain no one would have previously encountered
    this hex or anything like it.
2307:
  text: |-
    Harry didn't care about any of that.
2308:
  text: |-
    "<em>Ma-ha-su!</em> "
2309:
  text: |-
    A <em>red bolt of energy</em> shot out of his wand and struck the target and the
    blue sphere once again made the bing which meant the spell had <em>actually
    worked for him.</em>
2310:
  text: |-
    Harry was feeling like a real wizard for the first time since he'd come to
    Hogwarts. He wished the target would dodge like the little spheres that Ben
    Kenobi had used for training Luke, but for some reason Professor Quirrell had
    instead lined up all the students and targets in neat orders which made sure
    they wouldn't fire on each other.
2311:
  text: |-
    So Harry lowered his wand, skipped to the right, snapped up his wand and twisted
    and shouted "<em>Ma-ha-su!</em> "
2312:
  text: |-
    There was a lower-pitched "dong" which meant he'd gotten it almost right.
2313:
  text: |-
    Harry put his wand into his pocket, skipped back to the left and drew and fired
    another red bolt of energy.
2314:
  text: |-
    The high-pitched bing which resulted was easily one of the most satisfying
    sounds he'd heard in his life. Harry wanted to scream in triumph at the top of
    his lungs. <em>I CAN DO MAGIC! FEAR ME, LAWS OF PHYSICS, I'M COMING TO VIOLATE
    YOU!</em>
2315:
  text: |-
    "<em>Ma-ha-su!</em> " Harry's voice was loud, but hardly noticeable over the
    steady chant of similar cries from around the classroom platform.
2316:
  text: |-
    "Enough," said Professor Quirrell's amplified voice. (It didn't sound loud. It
    sounded like normal volume, coming from just behind your left shoulder, no
    matter where you were standing relative to Professor Quirrell.) "I see that all
    of you have succeeded at least once now." The target-spheres turned red and
    began to drift up towards the ceiling.
2317:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell was standing on the raised dais in the center of the
    platform, leaning slightly on his teacher's desk with one hand.
2318:
  text: |-
    "I told you," Professor Quirrell said, "that we would play a game called Who's
    the Most Dangerous Student in the Classroom. There is one student in this
    classroom who mastered the Sumerian Simple Strike Hex faster than anyone else -"
2319:
  text: |-
    Oh blah blah blah.
2320:
  text: |-
    "- and went on to help seven other students. For which she has earned the first
    seven Quirrell points awarded to your year. Come forth, Hermione Granger. It is
    time for the next stage of the game."
2321:
  text: |-
    Hermione Granger began striding forwards, a mixed look of triumph and
    apprehension on her face. The Ravenclaws looked on proudly, the Slytherins with
    glares, and Harry with frank annoyance. Harry had done fine this time. He was
    probably even in the upper half of the class, now that everyone had been faced
    with an equally unfamiliar spell and Harry had read all the way through Adalbert
    Waffling's <em>Magical Theory</em>. And yet <em>Hermione was still doing
    better</em>.
2322:
  text: |-
    Somewhere in the back of his mind was the fear that Hermione was simply smarter
    than him.
2323:
  text: |-
    But for now Harry was going to pin his hopes on the known facts that (a)
    Hermione had read a lot more than the standard textbooks and (b) Adalbert
    Waffling was an uninspired sod who'd written <em>Magical Theory</em> to pander
    to a school board that didn't think much of eleven-year-olds.
2324:
  text: |-
    Hermione reached the central dais and stepped up.
2325:
  text: |-
    "Hermione Granger mastered a completely unfamiliar spell in two minutes, almost
    a full minute faster than the next runner-up." Professor Quirrell turned slowly
    in place to look at all the students watching them. "Could Miss Granger's
    intelligence make her the most dangerous student in the classroom? Well? What do
    you think?"
2326:
  text: |-
    No one seemed to be thinking anything at the moment. Even Harry wasn't sure what
    to say.
2327:
  text: |-
    "Let's find out, shall we?" said Professor Quirrell. He turned back to Hermione,
    and gestured toward the wider class. "Select any student you like and cast the
    Simple Strike Hex on them."
2328:
  text: |-
    Hermione froze where she stood.
2329:
  text: |-
    "Come now," Professor Quirrell said smoothly. "You have cast this spell
    perfectly over fifty times. It is not permanently harmful or even all that
    painful. It hurts as much as a hard punch and lasts only a few seconds."
    Professor Quirrell's voice grew harder. "This is a direct order from your
    professor, Miss Granger. Choose a target and fire a Simple Strike Hex."
2330:
  text: |-
    Hermione's face was screwed up in horror and her wand was trembling in her hand.
    Harry's own fingers were clenching his own wand hard in sympathy. Even though he
    could see what Professor Quirrell was trying to do. Even though he could see the
    point Professor Quirrell was trying to make.
2331:
  text: |-
    "If you do <em>not</em> raise your wand and fire, Miss Granger, you will lose a
    Quirrell point."
2332:
  text: |-
    Harry stared at Hermione, willing her to look in his direction. His right hand
    was softly tapping his own chest. <em>Pick me, I'm not afraid...</em>
2333:
  text: |-
    Hermione's wand twitched in her hand; then her face relaxed, and she lowered her
    wand to her side.
2334:
  text: |-
    "No," said Hermione Granger.
2335:
  text: |-
    Her voice was calm, and even though it wasn't loud, everyone heard it in the
    silence.
2336:
  text: |-
    "Then I must deduct one point from you," said Professor Quirrell. "This is a
    test, and you have failed it."
2337:
  text: |-
    That reached her. Harry could see it. But she kept her shoulders straight.
2338:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell's voice was sympathetic and seemed to fill the whole room.
    "Knowing things isn't always enough, Miss Granger. If you cannot give and
    receive violence on the order of stubbing your toe, then you cannot defend
    yourself and you will not pass Defence. Please rejoin your classmates."
2339:
  text: |-
    Hermione walked back towards the Ravenclaw cluster. Her face looked peaceful and
    Harry, for some odd reason, wanted to start clapping. Even though Professor
    Quirrell had been <em>right</em>.
2340:
  text: |-
    "So," Professor Quirrell said. "It becomes clear that Hermione Granger is not
    the most dangerous student in the classroom. Who do you think might actually be
    the most dangerous person here? - besides me, of course."
2341:
  text: |-
    Without even thinking, Harry turned to look at the Slytherin contingent.
2342:
  text: |-
    "Draco, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy," said Professor Quirrell.
    "It seems that many of your fellow pupils are looking in your direction. Come
    forth, if you would."
2343:
  text: |-
    Draco did so, walking with a certain pride in his bearing. He stepped onto the
    dais and looked up at Professor Quirrell with a smile.
2344:
  text: |-
    "Mr. Malfoy," Professor Quirrell said. "Fire."
2345:
  text: |-
    Harry would have tried to stop it if there'd been time but in one smooth motion
    Draco spun on the Ravenclaw contingent and raised his wand and said
    "<em>Mahasu!</em> " like it was all one syllable and Hermione was saying "Ow!"
    and that was that.
2346:
  text: |-
    "Well struck," said Professor Quirrell. "Two Quirrell points to you. But tell
    me, why did you target Miss Granger?"
2347:
  text: |-
    There was a pause.
2348:
  text: |-
    Finally Draco said, "Because she stood out the most."
2349:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell's lips turned up in a thin smile. "And that is the true
    reason why Draco Malfoy is dangerous. Had he selected any other, that child
    would more likely resent being singled out, and Mr. Malfoy would more probably
    make an enemy. And while Mr. Malfoy might have given some other justification
    for selecting her, that would have served him no purpose save to alienate some
    of you, while others are already cheering him whether he says anything or not.
    Which is to say that Mr. Malfoy is dangerous because he knows who to strike and
    who not to strike, how to make allies and avoid making enemies. Two more
    Quirrell points to you, Mr. Malfoy. And as you have demonstrated an exemplary
    virtue of Slytherin, I think that Salazar's House has earned a point as well.
    You may rejoin your friends."
2350:
  text: |-
    Draco bowed slightly and walked back to the Slytherin contingent. Some clapping
    started from the green-trimmed robes, but Professor Quirrell made a cutting
    gesture and silence fell again.
2351:
  text: |-
    "It might seem that our game is done," said Professor Quirrell. "And yet there
    is a single student in this classroom who is more dangerous than the scion of
    Malfoy."
2352:
  text: |-
    And <em>now</em> for some reason there seemed to be an awful lot of people
    looking at...
2353:
  text: |-
    "Harry Potter. Come forth."
2354:
  text: |-
    This did not bode well.
2355:
  text: |-
    Harry reluctantly walked towards where Professor Quirrell stood on his raised
    dais, still leaning slightly against his teacher's desk.
2356:
  text: |-
    The nervousness of being put into the spotlight seemed to be sharpening Harry's
    wits as he approached the dais, and his mind was ruffling through possibilities
    for what Professor Quirrell might think could demonstrate Harry's dangerousness.
    Would he be asked to cast a spell? To defeat a Dark Lord?
2357:
  text: |-
    Demonstrate his supposed immunity to the Killing Curse? Surely Professor
    Quirrell was too smart for <em>that</em>...
2358:
  text: |-
    Harry stopped well short of the dais, and Professor Quirrell didn't ask him to
    come any closer.
2359:
  text: |-
    "The irony is," said Professor Quirrell, "you all looked at the right person for
    entirely the wrong reasons. You are thinking," Professor Quirrell's lips
    twisted, "that Harry Potter has defeated the Dark Lord, and so must be very
    dangerous. Bah. He was one year old. Whatever quirk of fate killed the Dark Lord
    likely had little to do with Mr. Potter's abilities as a fighter. But after I
    heard rumors of one Ravenclaw facing down five older Slytherins, I interviewed
    several eyewitnesses and came to the conclusion that Harry Potter would be my
    most dangerous student."
2360:
  text: |-
    A jolt of adrenaline poured into Harry's system, making him stand up straighter.
    He didn't know what conclusion Professor Quirrell had come to, but that couldn't
    be good.
2361:
  text: |-
    "Ah, Professor Quirrell -" Harry started to say.
2362:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell looked amused. "You're thinking that I've come up with a
    wrong answer, aren't you, Mr. Potter? You will learn to expect better of
    <em>me</em>." Professor Quirrell straightened from where he had leaned on the
    desk. "Mr. Potter, all things have their accustomed uses. Give me ten
    unaccustomed uses of objects in this room for combat!"
2363:
  text: |-
    For a moment Harry was rendered speechless by the sheer, raw shock of having
    been understood.
2364:
  text: |-
    And then the ideas started to pour out.
2365:
  text: |-
    "There are desks which are heavy enough to be fatal if dropped from a great
    height. There are chairs with metal legs that could impale someone if driven
    hard enough. The air in this classroom would be deadly by its absence, since
    people die in vacuum, and it can serve as a carrier for poison gases."
2366:
  text: |-
    Harry had to stop briefly for breath, and into that pause Professor Quirrell
    said:
2367:
  text: |-
    "That's three. You need ten. The rest of the class thinks that you've already
    used up the whole contents of the classroom."
2368:
  text: |-
    "<em>Ha!</em> The floor can be removed to create a spike pit to fall into, the
    ceiling can be collapsed on someone, the walls can serve as raw material for
    Transfiguration into any number of deadly things - knives, say."
2369:
  text: |-
    "That's six. But surely you're scraping the bottom of the barrel now?"
2370:
  text: |-
    "I haven't even started! Just look at all the people! Having a Gryffindor attack
    the enemy is an <em>ordinary</em> use, of course -"
2371:
  text: |-
    "I will not count that one."
2372:
  text: |-
    "- but their blood can also be used to drown someone. Ravenclaws are known for
    their brains, but their internal organs could be sold on the black market for
    enough money to hire an assassin. Slytherins aren't just useful as assassins,
    they can also be thrown at sufficient velocity to crush an enemy. And
    Hufflepuffs, in addition to being hard workers, also contain bones that can be
    removed, sharpened, and used to stab someone."
2373:
  text: |-
    By now the rest of the class was staring at Harry in some horror. Even the
    Slytherins looked shocked.
2374:
  text: |-
    "That's ten, though I'm being generous in counting the Ravenclaw one. Now, for
    extra credit, one Quirrell point for each use of objects in this room which you
    have not yet named." Professor Quirrell favored Harry with a companionable
    smile. "The rest of your class thinks you are in trouble now, since you've named
    everything except the targets and you have no idea what may be done with those."
2375:
  text: |-
    "Bah! I've named all the people, but not my robes, which can be used to
    suffocate an enemy if wrapped around their head enough times, or Hermione
    Granger's robes, which can be torn into strips and tied into a rope and used to
    hang someone, or Draco Malfoy's robes, which can be used to start a fire -"
2376:
  text: |-
    "Three points," said Professor Quirrell, "no more clothing now."
2377:
  text: |-
    "My wand can be pushed into an enemy's brain through their eye socket" and
    someone made a horrified, strangling sound.
2378:
  text: |-
    "Four points, no more wands."
2379:
  text: |-
    "My wristwatch could suffocate someone if jammed down their throat -"
2380:
  text: |-
    "Five points, and enough."
2381:
  text: |-
    "Hmph," Harry said. "Ten Quirrell points to one House point, right? You should
    have let me keep going until I'd won the House Cup, I haven't even started yet
    on the unaccustomed uses of everything I've got in my pockets" or the mokeskin
    pouch itself and he couldn't talk about the Time-Turner or the invisibility
    cloak but there had to be <em>something</em> he could say about those red
    spheres...
2382:
  text: |-
    "<em>Enough,</em> Mr. Potter. Well, do you all think you understand what makes
    Mr. Potter the most dangerous student in the classroom?"
2383:
  text: |-
    There was a low murmur of assent.
2384:
  text: |-
    "Say it out loud, please. Terry Boot, what makes your dorm-mate dangerous?"
2385:
  text: |-
    "Ah... um... he's creative?"
2386:
  text: |-
    "<em>Wrong!</em> " bellowed Professor Quirrell, and his fist came down sharply
    on his desk with an amplified sound that made everyone jump. "All of Mr.
    Potter's ideas were worse than useless!"
2387:
  text: |-
    Harry started in surprise.
2388:
  text: |-
    "Remove the floor to create a spike trap? Ridiculous! In combat you do not have
    that sort of preparation time and if you did there would be a hundred better
    uses! Transfigure material from the walls? Mr. Potter cannot perform
    Transfiguration! Mr. Potter had exactly one idea which he could use immediately,
    right now, without extensive preparation or a cooperative enemy or magic he does
    not know. That idea was to jam his wand through his enemy's eye socket. Which
    would be more likely to break his wand than kill his opponent! In short, Mr.
    Potter, I'm afraid that your proposals were uniformly awful."
2389:
  text: |-
    "What?" Harry said indignantly. "You <em>asked</em> for unusual ideas, not
    practical ones! I was thinking outside the box! How would <em>you</em> use
    something in this classroom to kill someone?"
2390:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell's expression was disapproving, but there were smile crinkles
    around his eyes. "Mr. Potter, I never said you were to <em>kill.</em> There is a
    time and a place for taking your enemy alive, and inside a Hogwarts classroom is
    usually one of those places. But to answer your question, hit them on the neck
    with the edge of a chair."
2391:
  text: |-
    There was some laughter from the Slytherins, but they were laughing with Harry,
    not at him.
2392:
  text: |-
    Everyone else was looking rather horrified.
2393:
  text: |-
    "But Mr. Potter has now demonstrated why he is the most dangerous student in the
    classroom. I asked for unaccustomed uses of items in this room for combat. Mr.
    Potter could have suggested using a desk to block a curse, or using a chair to
    trip an oncoming enemy, or wrapping cloth around his arm to create an improvised
    shield. Instead, every single use that Mr. Potter named was offensive rather
    than defensive, and either fatal or potentially fatal."
2394:
  text: |-
    What? Wait, that couldn't be true... Harry had a sudden sense of vertigo as he
    tried to remember what exactly he'd suggested, surely there had to be a
    counterexample...
2395:
  text: |-
    "And that," Professor Quirrell said, "is why Mr. Potter's ideas were so strange
    and useless - because he had to reach far into the impractical in order to meet
    his standard of <em>killing the enemy.</em> To him, any idea which fell short of
    that was not worth considering. This reflects a quality that we might call
    <em>intent to kill</em>. I have it. Harry Potter has it, which is how he could
    stare down five older Slytherins. Draco Malfoy does not have it, not yet. Mr.
    Malfoy would hardly shrink from talk of ordinary murder, but even he was shocked
    - yes you were Mr. Malfoy, I was watching your face - when Mr. Potter described
    how to use his classmates' bodies as raw material. There are censors inside your
    mind which make you flinch away from thoughts like that. Mr. Potter thinks
    <em>purely</em> of killing the enemy, he will grasp at any means to do so, he
    does not flinch, his censors are off. Even though his youthful genius is so
    undisciplined and impractical as to be useless, his <em>intent to kill</em>
    makes Harry Potter the Most Dangerous Student in the Classroom. One final point
    to him - no, let us make that a point to Ravenclaw - for this indispensable
    requisite of a true fighting wizard."
2396:
  text: |-
    Harry's mouth gaped open in speechless shock as he searched frantically for
    something to say to this. <em>That is so completely not what I am about!</em>
2397:
  text: |-
    But he could see that the other students were starting to believe it. Harry's
    mind was flipping through possible denials and not finding anything that could
    stand up against the authoritative voice of Professor Quirrell. The best Harry
    had come up with was "I'm not a psychopath, I'm just very creative" and that
    sounded kind of ominous. He needed to say something unexpected, something that
    would make people stop and reconsider -
2398:
  text: |-
    "And now," Professor Quirrell said. "Mr. Potter. Fire."
2399:
  text: |-
    Nothing happened, of course.
2400:
  text: |-
    "Ah, well," said Professor Quirrell. He sighed. "I suppose we must all start
    somewhere. Mr. Potter, select any student you please for a Simple Strike Hex.
    You <em>will</em> do so before I dismiss your class for the day. If you do not,
    I will begin deducting House points, and I will keep on deducting them until you
    do."
2401:
  text: |-
    Harry carefully raised his wand. He had to do that much, or Professor Quirrell
    might start deducting House points right away.
2402:
  text: |-
    Slowly, as though on a roasting platter, Harry turned to face the Slytherins.
2403:
  text: |-
    And Harry's eyes met Draco's.
2404:
  text: |-
    Draco Malfoy didn't look the slightest bit afraid. The blonde-haired boy wasn't
    giving any visible sign of assent such as Harry had given Hermione, but then he
    could hardly be expected to do so. The other Slytherins would think that rather
    odd.
2405:
  text: |-
    "Why the hesitation?" said Professor Quirrell. "Surely there's only one obvious
    choice."
2406:
  text: |-
    "Yes," Harry said. "Only one <em>obvious</em> choice."
2407:
  text: |-
    Harry twisted the wand and said "<em>Ma-ha-su!</em> "
2408:
  text: |-
    There was complete silence in the classroom.
2409:
  text: |-
    Harry shook his left arm, trying to get rid of the lingering sting.
2410:
  text: |-
    There was more silence.
2411:
  text: |-
    Finally Professor Quirrell sighed. "Yes, quite ingenious, but there was a lesson
    to be taught and you dodged it. One point from Ravenclaw for showing off your
    own cleverness at the expense of the actual goal. Class dismissed."
2412:
  text: |-
    And before anyone else could say anything, Harry sang out:
2413:
  text: |-
    "Just kidding! RAVENCLAW!"
2414:
  text: |-
    There was silence for a brief moment after that, a sound of people thinking, and
    then the murmurs started and rapidly rose to a roar of conversation.
2415:
  text: |-
    Harry turned towards Professor Quirrell, the two of them needed to talk -
2416:
  text: |-
    Quirrell had slumped over and was trudging back to his chair.
2417:
  text: |-
    No. Not acceptable. They <em>really</em> needed to talk. Stuff the zombie act,
    Professor Quirrell would probably wake up if Harry poked him a couple of times.
    Harry started forward -
2418:
  text: |-
    <em>WRONG<br/> DON'T<br/> BAD IDEA</em>
2419:
  text: |-
    Harry swayed and stopped in his tracks, feeling dizzy.
2420:
  text: |-
    And then a flock of Ravenclaws descended on him and the discussions began.
