    Even as Harry had raised the gun, he'd <em>known</em> he was making a mistake,
    his forebrain saw it and tried to stop his hand, but somehow the sick certainty
    didn't propagate fast enough to prevent his finger from pulling the trigger -
18597:
  text: |-
    The echo of the shots died away within the graveyard.
18598:
  text: |-
    A fraction of a second before Harry had pulled the trigger, Voldemort had jabbed
    his wand downward, and a wide wall of dirt had shot up between them from the
    graveyard earth, intercepting all three bullets.
18599:
  text: |-
    An instant after that, pain flared in Harry's scar, a crawling feeling came
    close to his skin; and then Harry's pouch, clothes, gun, everything except his
    wand disappeared, leaving him naked but for the wand still in his right hand,
    and the glasses he'd Charmed to stick to his nose. The steel ring upon his left
    pinky finger was yanked off hard enough to scrape skin, taking the Transfigured
    jewel with it.
18600:
  text: |-
    "That," said the voice of Voldemort from behind the dirt wall, "was
    <em>absolutely</em> predictable. Do you really think I would shout it aloud for
    you to hear, if my immortality were disrupted? Really, stupid child? Lower your
    wand, do not raise it up again at any time, or you die upon the spot."
18601:
  text: |-
    Harry swallowed, and pointed his wand downward. "You would have been
    disappointed in me," Harry said, his own voice now unusually high, "if I'd
    missed an opportunity like that, I mean." There was no time to think, and
    Harry's mouth was operating on autopilot for trying to placate evil overlords
    that might have paternal feelings for you and whom you'd just failed to
    assassinate.
18602:
  text: |-
    Voldemort stepped around from behind the dirt wall, smiling that horrible smile
    that seemed to contain too many teeth. "I promised not to raise my hand or wand
    against you, child, if you did not raise your hand or wand against me."
18603:
  text: |-
    "I used bullets," Harry said, his voice still high. "That's not a fist or a
    spell."
18604:
  text: |-
    "My curse thinks differently. That is the puzzle piece that you missed. Did you
    think I would leave the peace between us to mere fortune? Before I created you,
    I invoked a curse upon myself and all other Tom Riddles who would descend from
    me. A curse to enforce that none of us would threaten the others' immortality,
    so long as the other made no attempt upon our own. Typical of that ridiculous
    fiasco, the curse seems to have ended up binding me, but taking no hold upon the
    infant with his self so lost." A low, lethal chuckle. "<em>But you tried to end
    my true life jusst then, sstupid child. Now cursse iss lifted, and I may kill
    you any time I wissh.</em>"
18605:
  text: |-
    "I see," Harry said. He did see; <em>that</em> was why Voldemort had told him
    about his horcrux system in the first place, just to set up the moment when
    Harry knowingly tried to violate his immortality. Harry's mind was frantically
    churning through options, none of which seemed helpful. His pouch, his clothes,
    Harry saw by the moonlight that they all now lay in another heap by the altar,
    out of reach. "And now you kill me?" Harry still had his wand, presumably the
    Dark Lord couldn't cast his own magic on that, or his glasses, because of the
    disharmony. <em>Cast my own spell first? No, Voldemort just jabs his wand
    downward to make another shield, then shoots me - what else is there? WHAT
    ELSE?</em>
18606:
  text: |-
    "Still a fool. If no further matters remained between us, I would already have
    killed you." The dirt wall crumbled at another gesture of the wand, and
    Voldemort moved smoothly back toward the heap of items by the altar. The Dark
    Lord stretched out a hand, and the diary of Roger Bacon flew to him. "<em>Thiss
    iss, indeed, horcrux of girl-child, my ssuperior verssion.</em>" In his other
    hand appeared a parchment. "<em>Thiss iss ritual for ressurrecting her, if it
    musst be done again. Insstructionss are honesst, no trapss. Remember that girl-
    child'ss sspirit cannot float free like ghosst, Ressurrection Sstone iss my
    horcrux, not herss. Do not losse her horcrux, or her sspirit may be trapped
    within it.</em>" Voldemort reached down, picked up Harry's pouch, fed both the
    diary and the parchment into it. "<em>Remember that, in casse something goess
    wrong with next movess.</em>"
18607:
  text: |-
    "I don't understand what is happening," Harry said. There was nothing else left.
    "Please explain to me."
18608:
  text: |-
    The Dark Lord was now regarding Harry with a grim look. "<em>When girl-child
    died, wass in company of sschool'ss Sseer, heard prophecy sspoken that you would
    become force of vasst desstruction. You would become threat beyond imagination,
    beyond apocalypsse. That iss why I went to ssuch lengthss to undo my killing of
    girl-child, keep it undone."</em>
18609:
  text: |-
    "Are," what "are you sure," what.
18610:
  text: |-
    "<em>Dare not ssay sspecificss to you. Prophecy I heard of mysself led me to
    fulfill it. Have not forgotten that dissasster.</em>" Voldemort backed further
    away from Harry, red slitted eyes fixed upon the Boy-Who-Lived, gun unwavering
    in the left hand. "<em>All thiss, all I have done, iss to ssmassh that desstiny
    at every point of intervention. If ssome fate makess me fail in what comess
    next, idiot-child of foretold desstruction, then you musst kill yoursself to
    ssave girl-child. Elsse all you claim to value diess by your own hand.</em>"
18611:
  text: |-
    "I," Harry's voice went up an octave, "I," another octave, "I <em>really really
    wouldn't do that, seriously!"</em>
18612:
  text: |-
    "<em>Ssilence, fool. Remain ssilent unlesss given leave by me to sspeak. Keep
    your wand pointed down and do not raisse it unlesss told. Elsse you die upon the
    sspot, and mark that I ssaid that in Parsseltongue."</em> Voldemort reached into
    the altar again.

        By the way, now that that's over... why did Harry still have his wand? There
        were a lot of suspicions thrown around, but the most plausible I found was
        "because Quirrell expected Harry to have to demonstrate something for him".

          So that Harry could take the Unbreakable Vow, which used his wand. If not for
          Partial Transfiguration, that would have been relatively safe. Voldemort still
          underestimated Harry's threat level, in the end.
        </p>
        <p>
          I remark that the thought occurred to me later that if I were Voldemort I
          would have some Death Eaters looking outward, not everyone looking just at
          Harry... but nobody called <em>that</em> out as stupid, because you were told
          not to expect cavalry. Hindsight bias really is a thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          EDIT: Observe replies below saying "Voldemort should've taken away the wand."
          If Harry's glasses had contained something interesting instead, people would
          be saying, "Take away the glasses."
        </p>
        <p>
          I did look at the text to see if there was a natural place to insert Voldemort
          saying "Drop the wand now" after ordering his Death Eaters to vigilance again,
          with Harry refusing and Voldemort just continuing as before, but there didn't
          seem to be a natural such place.

    For a second Harry's mind couldn't process what he was seeing, and then he saw
    that Voldemort was holding a human arm, severed near the shoulder; it seemed too
    thin, that arm.
18614:
  text: |-
    The Dark Lord pressed his wand to the flesh above the severed arm's elbow, and
    the fingers twitched, twitched like they were alive; by dim moonlight Harry saw
    a darker mark appear on that flesh, just above the elbow.
18615:

    Seconds later the first hooded figure appeared inside the graveyard with the
    popping sound of an Apparition. A moment after that came another pop, and then
    another.
18616:
  text: |-
    The hooded figures wore silver skull masks, and moonlight fled from the robes
    beneath them.
18617:
  text: |-
    "Master!" cried one of the black robes, the third to arrive. The voice was of
    peculiar timbre, from behind the silver skull mask. "Master - it has been so
    long - we had lost hope -"
18618:
  text: |-
    "Silence!" shouted the high voice of the Dark Lord Voldemort. Every trace of
    Professor Quirrell was now gone from the too-tall figure. "Train your wand upon
    the Boy-Who-Lived, and watch him! Do not be distracted, not by anything! Stun
    him at once if he moves, if he begins to speak!"
18619:
  text: |-
    More pops. Between graves, behind a tree, in all the shadowy spaces, more black
    robes were Apparating, all hooded and masked. Some of them voiced exclamations
    of joy, many of those sounding rather forced; others moved forwards as though to
    greet their Master. Voldemort gave them all the same instruction, except that
    some were commanded to Cruciate Harry Potter if he moved, others to restrain the
    Boy-Who-Lived if he moved, others told to fire hexes and curses, others told to
    cancel his magic.
18620:
  text: |-
    Thirty-seven pops, Harry counted before the black robes and skull masks seemed
    to stop arriving.
18621:
  text: |-
    All of them were now holding their wands pointed at Harry, aligned in a
    semicircle before him, where they wouldn't get into each other's lines of fire.
18622:
  text: |-
    Harry continued pointing his wand downward, insofar as he had been told that, if
    he tried to raise it, he would die. He remained silent, insofar as he had been
    told that if he tried to speak, he would die. He tried not to shiver in the
    falling night temperatures, for he was naked, and it was getting colder.
18623:
  text: |-
    <em>You know,</em> said the last voice within Harry, the voice of hope, <em>I
    think this is getting pretty bad even by my standards.</em>
