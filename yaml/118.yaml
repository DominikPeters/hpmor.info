    The Sun shone down on the Scottish green, striking sparks of reflected white
    from every passing dewdrop or reflective leaf that happened to position itself
    correctly, a clear blue sky for a funeral.

    Harry had declined to give the eulogy. He'd declined for the second time.
    Professor Flitwick had asked him about it weeks ago in May, to give Harry time
    to write his lines before it would become necessary to speak; and Harry had said
    no then, too.

    So it fell to a sixth-year Gryffindor, Oliver Habryka, who had the fourth-
    highest total of Quirrell points among all the students, and who had been
    General of an army. The seventeen-year-old boy was tall and not especially
    handsome in solid black robes; instead of a red tie, he was wearing a purple tie
    such as Professor Quirrell had sometimes favored.
19009:
  text: |-
    Speaking, under the circumstances, <em>ex tempore.</em> The previous eulogies,
    written well in advance, had been discarded; Oliver Habryka had a parchment in
    his left hand, but he wasn't looking at it at all.

    "Professor Quirrell was very sick," the tall boy said, his wavering voice
    falling into a hush of students, occasionally broken by a muffled sob. "I think
    if Professor Quirrell had been able to fight in the fullness of his power, You-
    Know-Who couldn't have beat him easily, and maybe not at all. They say that
    David Monroe was the only one that You-Know-Who was ever afraid of, in his day.
    But," Oliver's voice broke, "Professor Quirrell wasn't in the fullness of his
    power. He was very sick. He had trouble walking by himself. And he went to face
    the Dark Lord, alone."

    There was a pause, then, while the students cried for a while.
19012:

    Oliver wiped away his tears with his sleeve, and spoke again. "We don't know
    exactly what happened," said Oliver. "I imagine the Dark Lord laughed at him.
    Maybe made fun of the Professor, for challenging him when he couldn't stand up.
    Well, <em>he's not laughing now,</em> is he."
19013:

    There were fierce nods from the students; all of them that Harry could see, from
    Gryffindor to Slytherin.
19014:
  text: |-
    "Maybe the Dark Lord knew some way of curing Professor Quirrell, You-Know-Who
    did come back from the dead after all. Maybe he offered Professor Quirrell his
    life if Professor Quirrell would serve him. Professor Quirrell smiled, and told
    the Dark Lord it was time for them to play a game called Who's The Most
    Dangerous Wizard In The World."
19015:
  text: |-
    <em>If you don't know, don't just make stuff up.</em> But Harry didn't say
    anything. It was what Lord Voldemort might have tried, it was what Professor
    Quirrell might have said back.
19016:

    "And they aren't telling us everything," Oliver said, "but we can guess what
    happened next. We all know that Hermione Granger, who was one of the Professor's
    best students, was killed by a troll earlier this year, it must have been the
    Dark Lord who made it happen, just like he framed her for the Blood-Cooling
    Charm. Professor Quirrell knew the Dark Lord was behind it, so he stole Miss
    Granger's body and preserved it, kept it safe -"
19017:
  text: |-
    Couldn't blame him for that one.
19018:
  text: |-
    "Then Professor Quirrell went out to face the Dark Lord. The Dark Lord killed
    Professor Quirrell. And Hermione Granger came back to life. They say she's alive
    and whole now, and maybe something more. When the Dark Lord tried to seize her,
    all that was left of him afterward was his burned robes and his hands around
    Miss Granger's throat. Just as Harry Potter was protected from the Killing Curse
    by his mother's love and sacrifice, Professor Quirrell willingly going out, to
    face, the Dark Lord alone, must have called, Hermione Granger's spirit, back
    from, from wherever, she was -" Oliver's voice was breaking.

    "Not just like that," Harry said from the front row of seats, his own voice
    hoarse. He <em>had</em> to say something at this point, before it got out of
    control. If it wasn't already out of control. "David Monroe was a powerful
    wizard, more powerful than anyone knew except him and me. I don't think you can
    bring someone back from the dead just by sacrificing yourself. No one should try
    doing it that way."
19020:
  text: |-
    Such a beautiful story. It should have been true. <em>It should have been
    true.</em>
19021:
  text: |-
    "I don't know very much about the person behind the Professor," Oliver Habryka
    said, after he got himself under control again. "I know David Monroe wasn't a
    happy man. He never could cast a Patronus Charm."
19022:
  text: |-
    Tears were gathering in Harry's eyes again. It wasn't right, it wasn't fair,
    Voldemort had killed so many people, he should have died along with his
    followers, he didn't deserve special treatment. But it hadn't just been Harry's
    weakness, it had been the horcruxes, Voldemort <em>couldn't</em> have been
    killed outright. So Harry could admit it, he was glad, he was <em>glad</em>
    Professor Quirrell wasn't all gone...
19023:
  text: |-
    "But I, know," said Oliver, tears glistening on his own cheeks, "Professor
    Quirrell, is happy, wherever, he is now."

    On Harry's left hand, a tiny emerald glowed bright beneath the morning sun.
19025:
  text: |-
    <em>Not Heaven, not some faraway star, not a different place but a better
    person, I'll show you, someday I'll show you how to be happy -</em>

    The tall boy glanced down at a parchment he held in his other hand, the first
    time he'd consulted it. "Professor Quirrell," Oliver said, his voice now fiercer
    and faster, "was, by far, the best Professor of Battle Magic that Hogwarts ever
    had. Salazar Slytherin couldn't have been half as good a teacher, no matter what
    spells he knew. Professor Quirrell told us at the beginning of this year that
    what he taught us would always be our firm foundation in the arts of Defense.
    And it will be. Forever. We'll teach it to the new students next year, no matter
    who we have for a professor. The older students will teach the younger ones.
    That's the solution to the curse on the Defense position. We won't sit around
    waiting for authority to teach us. And we'll make sure that Professor Quirrell's
    teachings never die out of Hogwarts."
19027:

    Harry looked at where Professor - no, Headmistress McGonagall - was sitting, and
    saw the Headmistress nodding silently, a look that was sad and stern and proud.
19028:
  text: |-
    "They haven't let us see Miss Granger yet," Oliver said. His voice quavered.
    "The Girl-Who-Revived. But I'll always think of the Defense Professor when I see
    her. His sacrifice lives on in her, just as his teachings live on in us." Oliver
    glanced at where Harry sat, then looked down again at the parchment. "Here's to
    Professor Quirrell, then, the best Slytherin that ever was, what every Slytherin
    should be! Three cheers for him!"

    <em>"Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah!"</em>

    No one stayed silent this time, not a single student that Harry could see.
