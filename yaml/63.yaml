    <em>Aftermath, Hermione Granger:</em>
10683:
  text: |-
    She was just starting to close up her books and put away her homework in
    preparation for sleep, Padma and Mandy stacking up their own books across the
    table from her, when Harry Potter walked into the Ravenclaw common room; and it
    was only then that she realized, she hadn't seen him at all since breakfast.
10684:
  text: |-
    That realization was rapidly stomped-on by a much more startling one.
10685:
  text: |-
    There was a golden-red winged creature on Harry's shoulder, a bright bird of
    fire.
10686:
  text: |-
    And Harry looked sad and worn and really <em>tired</em> like the phoenix was the
    only thing keeping him on his feet, but there was still a warmth about him, if
    you crossed your eyes you might have thought you were looking at the Headmaster
    somehow, that was the impression that went through Hermione's mind even though
    it didn't make any sense.
10687:
  text: |-
    Harry Potter trudged across the Ravenclaw common room, past sofas full of
    staring girls, past cardgame-circles of staring boys, heading for her.
10688:
  text: |-
    In theory she wasn't talking to Harry Potter yet, his week wasn't up until
    tomorrow, but whatever was going on was clearly a <em>whole</em> lot more
    important than that -
10689:
  text: |-
    "Fawkes," Harry said, just as she was opening her mouth, "that girl over there
    is Hermione Granger, she's not talking to me right now because I'm an idiot, but
    if you want to be on a good person's shoulder she's better than me."
10690:
  text: |-
    So much exhaustion and hurt in Harry Potter's voice -
10691:
  text: |-
    But before she could figure out what to do about it, the phoenix had glided off
    Harry's shoulder like a fire creeping up a matchstick on fast-forward, flashing
    toward her; there was a phoenix flying in front of her and staring at her with
    eyes of light and flame.
10692:
  text: |-
    "<em>Caw?</em> " asked the phoenix.
10693:
  text: |-
    Hermione stared at it, feeling like she was facing a question on a test she'd
    forgotten to study for, the one most important question and she'd gone her whole
    life without studying for it, she couldn't find anything to say.
10694:
  text: |-
    "I'm -" she said. "I'm only twelve, I haven't <em>done</em> anything yet -"
10695:
  text: |-
    The phoenix just glided gently around, rotating around one wingtip like the
    being of light and air that it was, and soared back to Harry Potter's shoulder,
    where it settled down quite firmly.
10696:
  text: |-
    "You silly boy," said Padma across from her, looking like she was deciding
    whether to laugh or grimace, "phoenixes aren't for smart girls who do their
    homework, they're for idiots who charge straight at five older Slytherin
    bullies. There's a reason why the Gryffindor colors are red and gold, you know."
10697:
  text: |-
    There was a lot of friendly laughter in the Ravenclaw common room.
10698:
  text: |-
    Hermione wasn't one of the laughing ones.
10699:
  text: |-
    Neither was Harry.
10700:
  text: |-
    Harry had put a hand over his face. "Tell Hermione I'm sorry," he said to Padma,
    his voice almost fallen to a whisper. "Tell her I forgot that phoenixes are
    animals, they don't understand time and planning, they don't understand people
    who are <em>going</em> to do good things later - I'm not sure they understand
    really the notion of there being something that a person <em>is</em>, all they
    see is what people do. Fawkes doesn't know what twelve means. Tell Hermione I'm
    sorry - I shouldn't have - it just all goes wrong, doesn't it?"
10701:
  text: |-
    Harry turned to go, the phoenix still on his shoulder, began slowly trudging
    toward the staircase that led up to his dorm.
10702:
  text: |-
    And Hermione couldn't leave it at that, she just <em>couldn't</em> leave it at
    that. She didn't know if it was her competition with Harry or something else.
    She just couldn't leave it with the phoenix turning away from her.
10703:
  text: |-
    She <em>had</em> to -
10704:
  text: |-
    Her mind keyed a frantic question to the entirety of her excellent memory, found
    just one thing -
10705:
  text: |-
    "I was going to run in front of the Dementor to try and save Harry!" she shouted
    a little desperately at the red-golden bird. "I mean, I actually did start
    running and everything! That was stupid and courageous, right?"
10706:
  text: |-
    With a warbling cry the phoenix launched itself from Harry's shoulder again,
    back toward her like a spreading blaze, it circled her three times like she was
    the center of an inferno, and for just a moment its wing brushed against her
    cheek, before the phoenix soared back to Harry.
10707:
  text: |-
    There was a hush in the Ravenclaw common room.
10708:
  text: |-
    "Told you so," Harry said aloud, and then he started climbing the stairs up to
    his bedroom; he seemed to climb very quickly, like he was very light on his feet
    for some reason, so that in just a moment he and Fawkes were gone.
10709:
  text: |-
    Hermione held up a trembling hand to her cheek where Fawkes had brushed her with
    his wing, a spot of warmth lingering there like that one small patch of skin had
    been very gently set on fire.
10710:
  text: |-
    She'd answered the question of the phoenix, she supposed, but it felt to her
    like she'd just barely squeaked by on the test, like she'd gotten a 62 and she
    could've gotten 104 if she'd tried harder.
10711:
  text: |-
    If she'd tried at <em>all</em>.
10712:
  text: |-
    She hadn't really <em>been</em> trying, when she thought about it.
10713:
  text: |-
    Just doing her homework -
10714:
  text: |-
    <em>Who have you saved?</em>

10715:
  text: |-
    <em>Aftermath, Fawkes:</em>
10716:
  text: |-
    Nightmares, the boy had expected, screams and begging and howling hurricanes of
    emptiness, the discharge of the horrors being laid down into memory, and in that
    fashion, perhaps, becoming part of the past.
10717:
  text: |-
    And the boy knew that the nightmares would come.
10718:
  text: |-
    The next night, they would come.
10719:
  text: |-
    The boy dreamed, and in his dreams the world was on fire, Hogwarts was on fire,
    his home was on fire, the streets of Oxford were on fire, all ablaze with golden
    flames that shone but did not consume, and all the people walking through the
    blazing streets were shining with white light brighter than the fire, like they
    were flames themselves, or stars.
10720:
  text: |-
    The other first-year boys came to bed, and saw it for themselves, the wonder
    whose rumor they had already heard, that in his bed Harry Potter lay silent and
    motionless, a gentle smile on his face, while perched on his pillow a red-golden
    bird watched over him, with bright wings swept above him like a blanket pulled
    over his head.
10721:
  text: |-
    The reckoning had been put off one more night.
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
10722:
  text: |-
    <em>Aftermath, Draco Malfoy:</em>
10723:
  text: |-
    Draco straightened his robes, making sure the green trim was straight. He waved
    his wand over his own head and said a Charm that Father had taught him while
    other children were still playing in mud, a Charm which ensured that not a
    single speck of lint or dust would dirty his wizard's robes.
10724:
  text: |-
    Draco picked up the mysterious envelope that Father had owled him, and tucked it
    into his robes. He had already used <em>Incendio</em> and <em>Everto</em> on the
    mysterious note.
10725:
  text: |-
    And then he headed off to breakfast, to seat himself on exactly the same tick of
    the clock where the food appeared, if he could manage it, so that it would seem
    like all others had been waiting on his appearance to eat. Because when you were
    the scion of Malfoy you were first in everything, including breakfast, that was
    why.
10726:
  text: |-
    Vincent and Gregory were waiting for him outside the door of his private room,
    up even before he was - though not, of course, dressed quite as sharply.
10727:
  text: |-
    The Slytherin common room was deserted, anyone who got up this early was heading
    straight to breakfast anyway.
10728:
  text: |-
    The dungeon halls were silent but for their own footsteps, empty and echoing.
10729:
  text: |-
    The Great Hall was a hubbub of alarm despite the relative few arrivals, some
    younger children crying, students running back and forth between tables or
    standing in knots shouting at each other, a red-robed prefect was standing in
    front of two green-trimmed students and yelling at them and Snape was striding
    toward the mess -
10730:
  text: |-
    The noise dimmed a little as people caught sight of Draco, as some of the faces
    turned to stare at him, and fell quiet.
10731:
  text: |-
    The food appeared on the tables. No one looked at it.
10732:
  text: |-
    And Snape spun on his heel, abandoning his target, and headed straight toward
    Draco.
10733:
  text: |-
    A knot of fear clutched at Draco's heart, had something happened to Father - no,
    surely Father would have told him - whatever was happening, why hadn't Father
    told him -
10734:
  text: |-
    There were bags of fatigue beneath Snape's eyes, Draco saw as their Head of
    House came close, the Potions Master had never been a sharp dresser (that was an
    understatement) but his robes were even dirtier and more disarrayed this
    morning, spotted with extra grease.
10735:
  text: |-
    "You haven't heard?" hissed their Head of House as he came close. "For pity's
    sake, Malfoy, don't you have a newspaper delivered?"
10736:
  text: |-
    "What is it, Profe-"
10737:
  text: |-
    "Bellatrix Black was taken from Azkaban!"
10738:
  text: |-
    "<em>What?</em> " said Draco in shock, as Gregory behind him said something he
    really shouldn't have and Vincent just gasped.
10739:
  text: |-
    Snape was gazing at him with narrowed eyes, then nodded abruptly. "Lucius told
    you nothing, then. I see." Snape gave a snort, turned away -
10740:
  text: |-
    "Professor!" said Draco. The implications were just starting to dawn on him, his
    mind spinning frantically. "Professor, what should I do - Father didn't instruct
    me -"
10741:
  text: |-
    "Then I <em>suggest</em>," Snape said sneeringly, as he strode away, "that you
    <em>tell</em> them that, Malfoy, as your father intended!"
10742:
  text: |-
    Draco glanced back at Vincent and Gregory, though he didn't know why he was
    bothering, of course they looked even more confused than he did.
10743:
  text: |-
    And Draco walked forward to the Slytherin table, and sat down at the far end,
    which was still empty of sitters.
10744:
  text: |-
    Draco put a sausage omelet on his plate, began eating it with automatic motions.
10745:
  text: |-
    Bellatrix Black had been taken from Azkaban.
10746:
  text: |-
    Bellatrix Black had been taken from Azkaban...?
10747:
  text: |-
    Draco didn't know what to make of that, it was as totally unexpected as the Sun
    going out - well, the Sun would expectedly go out in six billion years but this
    was as unexpected as the Sun going out <em>tomorrow</em>. Father wouldn't have
    done it, Dumbledore wouldn't have done it, <em>no one</em> should have been
    <em>able</em> to do it - what did it <em>mean</em> - what <em>use</em> would
    Bellatrix be to anyone after ten years in Azkaban - even if she got strong
    again, what use was a powerful sorceress who was completely evil and insane and
    fanatically devoted to a Dark Lord who wasn't around anymore?
10748:
  text: |-
    "Hey," said Vincent from where he was sitting next to Draco, "I don't
    understand, boss, why'd we do that?"
10749:
  text: |-
    "<em>We</em> didn't do it, you dolt!" snapped Draco. "Oh, for Merlin's sake, if
    even <em>you</em> think we - didn't your father ever tell you any stories about
    Bellatrix Black? She tortured Father once, she tortured <em>your</em> father,
    she's tortured <em>everyone,</em> the Dark Lord once told her to Crucio
    <em>herself</em> and she <em>did it!</em> She didn't do crazy things to inspire
    fear and obedience in the populace, she did crazy things because she's crazy!
    She's a <em>bitch</em> is what she is!"
10750:
  text: |-
    "Oh, really?" said an incensed voice from behind Draco.
10751:
  text: |-
    Draco didn't look up. Gregory and Vincent would be watching his back.
10752:
  text: |-
    "I would've thought you'd be happy -"
10753:
  text: |-
    "- to hear that a Death Eater had been freed, Malfoy!"
10754:
  text: |-
    Amycus Carrow had always been one of the <em>other</em> problem people; Father
    had once told Draco to make sure he was never alone in the same room with
    Amycus...
10755:
  text: |-
    Draco turned around and gave Flora and Hestia Carrow his Number Three Sneer, the
    one that said that he was in a Noble and Most Ancient House and they weren't and
    yes, that mattered. Draco said in their general direction, certainly not
    deigning to address <em>them</em> in particular, "There's Death Eaters and then
    there's Death Eaters," and then turned back to his food.
10756:
  text: |-
    There were two furious huffs in unison, and then two pairs of shoes stormed off
    toward the other end of the Slytherin table.
10757:
  text: |-
    It was a few minutes later that Millicent Bulstrode ran up to them, visibly out
    of breath, and said, "Mr. Malfoy, did you hear?"
10758:
  text: |-
    "About Bellatrix Black?" said Draco. "Yeah -"
10759:
  text: |-
    "No, about Potter!"
10760:
  text: |-
    "What?"
10761:
  text: |-
    "Potter was going around with a <em>phoenix</em> on his shoulder last night,
    looking like he'd been dragged through ten leagues of mud, they say that the
    phoenix took him to Azkaban to try to stop Bellatrix and he fought a duel with
    her and they blew up half the fortress!"
10762:
  text: |-
    "<em>What?</em> " said Draco. "Oh, there is just no <em>way</em> that -"
10763:
  text: |-
    Draco stopped.
10764:
  text: |-
    He'd said that a number of times about Harry Potter and had started to notice a
    trend.
10765:
  text: |-
    Millicent ran off to tell someone else.
10766:
  text: |-
    "You don't <em>really</em> think -" said Gregory.
10767:
  text: |-
    "I honestly don't know anymore," said Draco.
10768:
  text: |-
    A few minutes later, after Theodore Nott had sat down across from him and
    William Rosier had gone to sit with the Carrow twins, Vincent nudged him and
    said, "There."
10769:
  text: |-
    Harry Potter had entered the Great Hall.
10770:
  text: |-
    Draco watched him closely.
10771:
  text: |-
    There was no alarm on Harry's face as he saw, no surprise or shock, he just
    looked...
10772:
  text: |-
    It was the same distant, self-absorbed look Harry wore when he was trying to
    figure out the answer to a question Draco couldn't understand yet.
10773:
  text: |-
    Draco hastily shoved himself up from the bench of the Slytherin table, saying
    "Stay behind," and walked with all decorous speed toward Harry.
10774:
  text: |-
    Harry seemed to notice his approach just as the other boy was turning toward the
    Ravenclaw table, and Draco -
10775:
  text: |-
    - gave Harry one quick look -
10776:
  text: |-
    - and then walked right past him, straight out of the Great Hall.
10777:
  text: |-
    It was a minute later that Harry peered around the corner of the small stony
    nook where Draco had waited, it might not fool everyone but it would create
    plausible deniability.
10778:
  text: |-
    "<em>Quietus</em>," said Harry. "Draco, what -"
10779:
  text: |-
    Draco took the envelope out of his robes. "I have a message for you from
    Father."
10780:
  text: |-
    "<em>Huh?</em> " said Harry, and took the envelope from Draco, and tore it open
    in a rather un-neat manner, and drew forth a sheet of parchment and unfolded it
    and -
10781:
  text: |-
    Harry gave a sharp intake of breath.
10782:
  text: |-
    Then Harry looked at Draco.
10783:
  text: |-
    Then Harry looked back down at the parchment.
10784:
  text: |-
    There was a pause.
10785:
  text: |-
    Harry said, "Did Lucius tell you to report on my reaction to this?"
10786:
  text: |-
    Draco paused for a moment, weighing, and then opened his mouth -
10787:
  text: |-
    "I see he did," said Harry, and Draco cursed himself, he should've known better,
    only it <em>had</em> been hard to decide. "What are you going to tell him?"
10788:
  text: |-
    "That you were surprised," said Draco.
10789:
  text: |-
    "Surprised," Harry said flatly. "Yeah. Good. Tell him that."
10790:
  text: |-
    "What <em>is</em> it?" said Draco. And then, as he saw Harry looking conflicted,
    "If you're dealing with Father behind my back -"
10791:
  text: |-
    And Harry, without a word, gave Draco the paper.
10792:
  text: |-
    It said:
10793:
  text: |-
    <em>I know it was you.</em>
10794:
  text: |-
    "<em>WHAT THE -</em>"
10795:
  text: |-
    "I was going to ask <em>you</em> that," said Harry. "Have you got <em>any</em>
    idea what's up with your Dad?"
10796:
  text: |-
    Draco stared at Harry.
10797:
  text: |-
    Then Draco said, "<em>Did</em> you do it?"
10798:
  text: |-
    "What?" said Harry. "What <em>possible</em> reason would I - <em>how</em> would
    I -"
10799:
  text: |-
    "Did you do it, Harry?"
10800:
  text: |-
    "No!" Harry said. "Of course not!"
10801:
  text: |-
    Draco had listened carefully, but he hadn't detected any hesitation or tremor.
10802:
  text: |-
    So Draco nodded, and said, "I've got no idea what Father's thinking but it
    <em>can't</em>, I mean it <em>can't possibly</em> be good. And, um... people are
    also saying..."
10803:
  text: |-
    "What," said Harry warily, "are they saying, Draco?"
10804:
  text: |-
    "Did a phoenix <em>really</em> take you to Azkaban to try to stop Bellatrix
    Black from escaping -"

10805:
  text: |-
    <em>Aftermath: Neville Longbottom</em>
10806:
  text: |-
    Harry had only just sat down at the Ravenclaw table for the first time, hoping
    to grab a quick bite of food. He knew he needed to go off and think about
    things, but there was a tiny remaining bit of phoenix's peace (even after the
    encounter with Draco) that he still wanted to cling to, some beautiful dream of
    which he remembered nothing but the beauty; and the part of him that
    <em>wasn't</em> feeling peaceful was waiting for all the anvils to finish
    dropping on him, so that when he went off to think and be by himself for a
    while, he could batch-process all the disasters at once.
10807:
  text: |-
    Harry's hand grasped a fork, lifted a bite of mashed potatoes toward his mouth -
10808:
  text: |-
    And there was a shriek.
10809:
  text: |-
    Every now and then someone would shout when they heard the news, but Harry's
    ears <em>recognized</em> this one -
10810:
  text: |-
    Harry was up from the bench in an instant, heading toward the Hufflepuff table,
    a horrible sick feeling dawning in the pit of his stomach. It was one of those
    things he hadn't considered when he'd decided to commit the crime, because
    Professor Quirrell had planned for no one to know; and now, afterward, Harry
    just - hadn't <em>thought</em> of it -
10811:
  text: |-
    <em>This,</em> Hufflepuff said with bitter intensity, <em>is also your
    fault.</em>
10812:
  text: |-
    But by the time Harry got there, Neville was sitting down and eating fried
    sausage patties with Snippyfig Sauce.
10813:
  text: |-
    The Hufflepuff boy's hands were trembling, but he cut the food, and ate it,
    without dropping it.
10814:
  text: |-
    "Hello, General," Neville said, his voice wavering only slightly. "Did you fight
    a duel with Bellatrix Black last night?"
10815:
  text: |-
    "No," Harry said. His own voice was also wavery, for some reason.
10816:
  text: |-
    "Didn't think so," said Neville. There was a scraping sound as his knife cut the
    sausage again. "I'm going to hunt her down and kill her, can I count on you to
    help?"
10817:
  text: |-
    There were startled gasps from the mass of Hufflepuffs who had gathered around
    Neville.
10818:
  text: |-
    "If she comes after you," Harry said hoarsely, <em>if it was all a terrible
    mistake, if it was all a lie,</em> "I'll defend you even with my life,"
    <em>won't let you get hurt for what I did, no matter what,</em> "but I won't
    help you go after her, Neville, friends don't help friends commit suicide."
10819:
  text: |-
    Neville's fork paused on the way to his mouth.
10820:
  text: |-
    Then Neville put the bite of food in his mouth, chewed again.
10821:
  text: |-
    And Neville swallowed it.
10822:
  text: |-
    And Neville said, "I didn't mean <em>right now</em>, I mean after I graduate
    Hogwarts."
10823:
  text: |-
    "Neville," Harry said, keeping his voice under very careful control, "I think,
    even after you graduate, that might still be a <em>just plain</em> <em>stupid
    idea.</em> There's got to be much more experienced Aurors tracking her -"
    <em>oh, wait, that's not good</em> -
10824:
  text: |-
    "Listen to him!" said Ernie Macmillan, and then an older-looking Hufflepuff girl
    standing close to Neville said, "Nevvy, please, think about it, he's right!"
10825:
  text: |-
    Neville stood up.
10826:
  text: |-
    Neville said, "Please don't follow me."
10827:
  text: |-
    Neville walked away from all of them; Harry and Ernie reaching out involuntarily
    toward him, and some of the other Hufflepuffs as well.
10828:
  text: |-
    And Neville sat down at the Gryffindor table, and distantly (though they had to
    strain to hear) they heard Neville say, "I'm going to hunt her down and kill her
    after I graduate, anyone want to help?" and at least five voices said "Yes" and
    then Ron Weasley said loudly, "Get in line, you lot, I got an owl from Mum this

    Someone tapped Harry on the shoulder, and he turned around and saw an unfamiliar
    green-trimmed older girl, who handed him a parchment envelope and then quickly
    strode away.
10830:
  text: |-
    Harry stared at the envelope for a moment, then started walking toward the
    nearest wall. That wasn't very private, but it should be private enough, and
    Harry didn't want to give the impression of having much to hide.
10831:
  text: |-
    That had been a Slytherin System delivery, what you used if you wanted to
    communicate with someone without anyone else knowing that the two of you had
    talked. The sender gave an envelope to someone who had a reputation for being a
    reliable messenger, along with ten Knuts; that first person would take five
    Knuts and pass the envelope to another messenger along with the other five
    Knuts, and the second messenger would open up that envelope and find another
    envelope with a name written on it and deliver that envelope to that person.
    That way neither of the two people passing the message knew both the sender
    <em>and</em> the recipient, so no one else knew that those two parties had been
    in contact...
10832:
  text: |-
    When Harry reached the wall, he put the envelope inside his robes, opened it
    beneath the folds of cloth, and carefully snuck a peek at the parchment he drew
    forth.
10833:

    It said,
10834:

    <em>Classroom to the left of Transfiguration, 8 in the morning.</em>
10835:

    <em>- LL.</em>
10836:

    Harry stared at it, trying to remember if he knew anyone with the initials LL.

    <em>Aftermath: Lesath Lestrange.</em>
10842:
  text: |-
    Harry was standing in the unused classroom next to Transfiguration at 8AM,
    waiting, he'd at least managed to get some food into himself before facing the
    next disaster, Luna Lovegood...
10843:
  text: |-
    The door to the classroom opened, and Harry saw, and gave himself a really
    <em>hard</em> mental kick.
10844:
  text: |-
    One more thing he hadn't thought of, one more thing he <em>really should
    have.</em>
10845:
  text: |-
    The older boy's green-trimmed formal robes were askew, there were red spots on
    them looking very much like small dots of fresh blood, and one corner of his
    mouth had the look of a place that had been cut and healed, by <em>Episkey</em>
    or some other minor medical Charm that didn't quite erase all the damage.
10846:
  text: |-
    Lesath Lestrange's face was streaked with tears, fresh tears and half-dried
    tears, and there was water in his eyes, a promise of still more on the way.
    "<em>Quietus,</em>" said the older boy, and then "<em>Homenum Revelio</em>" and
    some other things, while Harry thought frantically and without much luck.
10847:
  text: |-
    And then Lesath lowered his wand and sheathed it in his robes, and slowly this
    time, formally, the older boy dropped to his knees on the dusty classroom floor.
10848:
  text: |-
    Bowed his head all the way down, until his forehead also touched the dust, and
    Harry would have spoken but he was voiceless.
10849:
  text: |-
    Lesath Lestrange said, in a breaking voice, "My life is yours, my Lord, and my
    death as well."
10850:
  text: |-
    "I," Harry said, there was a huge lump in his throat and he was having trouble
    speaking, "I -" <em>didn't have anything to do with it,</em> he should have been
    saying, should be saying <em>right now,</em> but then again the innocent Harry
    would have had trouble speaking too -
10851:
  text: |-
    "Thank you," whispered Lesath, "thank you, my Lord, oh, thank you," the sound of
    a choked-off sob came from the kneeling boy, all Harry could see of him was the
    hair on the back of his head, nothing of his face. "I'm a fool, my Lord, an
    ungrateful bastard, unworthy to serve you, I cannot abase myself enough, for I -
    I shouted at you after you helped me, because I thought you were refusing me,
    and I didn't even realize until this morning that I'd been such a fool as to ask
    you in front of Longbottom -"
10852:
  text: |-
    "I didn't have anything to do with it," Harry said.
10853:
  text: |-
    (It was still very hard to tell an outright lie like that.)
10854:
  text: |-
    Slowly Lesath raised his head from the floor, looked up at Harry.
10855:
  text: |-
    "I understand, my Lord," said the older boy, his voice wavering a little, "you
    do not trust my cunning, and indeed I have shown myself a fool... I only wanted
    to say to you, that I am not ungrateful, that I know it must have been hard
    enough to save only one person, that they're alerted now, that you can't - get
    Father - but I am not ungrateful, I will never be ungrateful to you again. If
    ever you have a use for this unworthy servant, call me wherever I am, and I will
    answer, my Lord -"
10856:
  text: |-
    "I was not involved in any way."
10857:
  text: |-
    (But it got easier each time.)
10858:
  text: |-
    Lesath gazed up at Harry, said uncertainly, "Am I dismissed from your presence,
    my Lord...?"
10859:
  text: |-
    "I am not your Lord."
10860:
  text: |-
    Lesath said, "Yes, my Lord, I understand," and pushed himself back up from the
    floor, stood straight and bowed deeply, then backed away from Harry until he
    turned to open the classroom door.
10861:
  text: |-
    As Lesath's hand touched the doorknob, he paused.
10862:
  text: |-
    Harry couldn't see Lesath's face, as the older boy's voice said, "Did you send
    her to someone who would take care of her? Did she ask about me at all?"
10863:
  text: |-
    And Harry said, his voice perfectly level, "Please stop that. I was not involved
    in any way."
10864:
  text: |-
    "Yes, my Lord, I'm sorry, my Lord," said Lesath's voice; and the Slytherin boy
    opened the door and went out and shut the door behind him. His feet sped up as
    he ran away, but not fast enough that Harry couldn't hear him start sobbing.
10865:
  text: |-
    <em>Would I cry?</em> wondered Harry. <em>If I knew nothing, if I was innocent,
    would I cry right now?</em>
10866:
  text: |-
    Harry didn't know, so he just kept looking at the door.
10867:
  text: |-
    And some unbelievably tactless part of him thought, <em>Yay, we completed a
    quest and got a minion -</em>

10870:

    "Then his life isn't in danger, I take it," said Amelia.
10871:
  text: |-
    The healer, a stern-eyed old man who wore his robes white (he was a Muggleborn
    and honoring some strange tradition of Muggles, of which Amelia had never asked,
    although privately she thought it made him look too much like a ghost), shook
    his head and said, "Definitely not."
10872:
  text: |-
    Amelia looked at the human form resting unconscious on the healer's bed, the
    burned and blasted flesh, the thin sheet that covered him for modesty's sake
    having been peeled back at her command.
10873:
  text: |-
    He might make a full recovery.
10874:

    He might not.
10875:

    The healer had said it was too early to say.
10876:

    Then Amelia looked at the other witch in the room, the detective.
10877:
  text: |-
    "And you say," Amelia said, "that the burning matter was Transfigured from
    <em>water</em>, presumably in the form of ice."
10878:
  text: |-
    The detective nodded her head, and said, sounding puzzled, "It could have been
    much worse, if not for -"
10879:
  text: |-
    "How <em>very nice</em> of them," she spat, and then pressed a weary hand to her
    forehead. No... no, it <em>had</em> been intended as a kindness. By the final
    stage of the escape there would be no point in trying to fool anyone. Whoever
    had done this, then, <em>had</em> been trying to mitigate the damage - and
    they'd been thinking in terms of Aurors breathing the smoke, not of anyone being
    attacked with the fire. If it had been them still in control, no doubt, they
    would have steered the rocker more mercifully.
10880:
  text: |-
    But Bellatrix Black had ridden the rocker out of Azkaban alone, all the watching
    Aurors had agreed on that, they'd had their Anti-Disillusionment Charms active
    and there had been only one woman on that rocker, though the rocker had sported
    two sets of stirrups.
10881:
  text: |-
    Some good and innocent person, capable of casting the Patronus Charm, had been
    tricked into rescuing Bellatrix Black.
10882:
  text: |-
    Some innocent had fought Bahry One-Hand, carefully subduing an experienced Auror
    without significantly injuring him.
10883:
  text: |-
    Some innocent had Transfigured the fuel for the Muggle artifact on which the two
    of them had been to ride out of Azkaban, making it from frozen water for the
    benefit of her Aurors.
10884:
  text: |-
    And then their usefulness to Bellatrix Black had ended.
10885:
  text: |-
    You would have expected anyone capable of subduing Bahry One-Hand to have
    foreseen that part. But then you wouldn't have expected anyone who could cast
    the Patronus Charm to try rescuing Bellatrix Black in the first place.

    Amelia passed her hand down over her eyes, closing them for a moment in silent
    mourning. <em>I wonder who it was, and how You-Know-Who manipulated them... what

10887:

    She didn't even realize until a moment later that the thought meant she was

    <em>Aftermath, Alastor Moody and Severus Snape:</em>
10926:
  text: |-
    When Alastor Moody had lost his eye, he had commandeered the services of a most
    erudite Ravenclaw, Samuel H. Lyall, whom Moody mistrusted slightly less than
    average because Moody had refrained from reporting him as an unregistered
    werewolf; and he had paid Lyall to compile a list of every known magical eye,
    and every known hint to their location.
10927:
  text: |-
    When Moody had gotten the list back, he hadn't bothered reading most of it;
    because at the top of the list was the Eye of Vance, dating back to an era
    before Hogwarts, and currently in the possession of a powerful Dark Wizard
    ruling over some tiny forgotten hellhole that wasn't in Britain or anywhere else
    he'd have to worry about silly rules.
10928:
  text: |-
    That was how Alastor Moody had lost his left foot and acquired the Eye of Vance,
    and how the oppressed souls of Urulat had been liberated for a period of around
    two weeks before another Dark Wizard moved in on the power vacuum.
10929:
  text: |-
    He'd considered going after the Left Foot of Vance next, but had decided against
    it after he realized that would be <em>just what they were expecting.</em>
10930:
  text: |-
    Now Mad-Eye Moody was turning slowly, always turning, surveying the graveyard of
    Little Hangleton. It should have been a lot gloomier, that place, but in the
    broad daylight it seemed like nothing but a grassy place marked by ordinary
    tombstones, demarcated by the chained twists of fragile, easily climbable metal
    that Muggles used instead of wards. (Moody could not comprehend what the Muggles
    were thinking on that score, if they were <em>pretending</em> to have wards, or
    what, and he had decided not to ask whether Muggle criminals respected the
    pretense.)
10931:
  text: |-
    Moody didn't actually <em>need</em> to turn to survey the graveyard.
10932:
  text: |-
    The Eye of Vance saw the full globe of the world in every direction around him,
    no matter where it was pointing.
10933:
  text: |-
    But there was no particular reason to let a former Death Eater like Severus
    Snape know that.
10934:
  text: |-
    Sometimes people called Moody 'paranoid'.
10935:
  text: |-
    Moody always told them to survive a hundred years of hunting Dark Wizards and
    then get back to him about that.
10936:
  text: |-
    Mad-Eye Moody had once worked out how long it had taken him, in retrospect, to
    achieve what he now considered a decent level of caution - weighed up how much
    experience it had taken him to get <em>good</em> instead of <em>lucky</em> - and
    had begun to suspect that most people died before they got there. Moody had once
    expressed this thought to Lyall, who had done some ciphering and figuring, and
    told him that a typical Dark Wizard hunter would die, on average, eight and a
    half times along the way to becoming 'paranoid'. This explained a great deal,
    assuming Lyall wasn't lying.
10937:
  text: |-
    Yesterday, Albus Dumbledore had told Mad-Eye Moody that the Dark Lord had used
    unspeakable dark arts to survive the death of his body, and was now awake and
    abroad, seeking to regain his power and begin the Wizarding War anew.
10938:
  text: |-
    Someone else might have reacted with incredulity.
10939:
  text: |-
    "I can't believe you lot never told me about this resurrection thing," Mad-Eye
    Moody said with considerable acerbity. "D'you realize how long it'll take me to
    do the grave of every ancestor of every Dark Wizard I've ever killed who
    could've been smart enough to make a horcrux? You're not just <em>now</em> doing
    this one, are you?"
10940:
  text: |-
    "I redose this one every year," Severus Snape said calmly, uncapping the third
    flask of what the man had <em>claimed</em> would be seventeen bottles, and
    beginning to wave his wand over it. "The other ancestral graves we've been able
    to locate were poisoned with only the long-lasting substances, since some of us
    have less free time than yourself."
10941:
  text: |-
    Moody watched the fluid spiraling out of the vial and vanishing, to appear
    within the bones where marrow had once been. "But you think it's worth the
    effort of the trap, instead of just Vanishing the bones."
10942:
  text: |-
    "He <em>does</em> have other avenues to life, should he perceive this one
    blocked," Snape said dryly, uncapping a fourth bottle. "And before you ask, it
    must be the original grave, the place of first burial, the bone removed during
    the ritual and not before. Thus he cannot have retrieved it earlier; and also
    there is no point in substituting the skeleton of a weaker ancestor. He would
    notice it had lost all potency."
10943:
  text: |-
    "Who else knows about this trap?" Moody demanded.
10944:
  text: |-
    "You. Me. The Headmaster. No one else."
10945:
  text: |-
    Moody snorted. "Pfah. Did Albus tell Amelia, Bartemius, and that McGonagall
    woman about the resurrection ritual?"
10946:
  text: |-
    "Yes -"
10947:
  text: |-
    "If Voldie finds out that Albus knows about the resurrection ritual and that
    Albus told <em>them</em>, Voldie'll figure that Albus told <em>me,</em> and
    Voldie <em>knows</em> I'd think of this." Moody shook his head in disgust.
    "What're these other ways Voldie could come back to life?"
10948:
  text: |-
    Snape's hand paused on the fifth bottle (it was all Disillusioned, of course,
    the whole operation was Disillusioned, but that meant less than nothing to
    Moody, it just marked you in his Eye's sight as trying-to-hide), and the former
    Death Eater said, "You don't need to know."
10949:
  text: |-
    "You're learning, son," said Moody with mild approval. "What's in the bottles?"
10950:
  text: |-
    Snape opened the fifth bottle, gestured with his wand to begin the substance
    flowing toward the grave, and said, "This one? A Muggle narcotic called LSD. A
    conversation yesterday put me in mind of Muggle things, and LSD seemed the most
    interesting option, so I hurried to obtain some. If it is incorporated into the
    resurrection potion, I suspect its effects will be permanent."
10951:
  text: |-
    "What does it do?" said Moody.
10952:
  text: |-
    "It is said that the effects are impossible to describe to anyone who has not
    used it," drawled Snape, "and I have not used it."
10953:
  text: |-
    Moody nodded approval as Snape opened the sixth flask. "What about that one?"
10954:
  text: |-
    "Love potion."
10955:
  text: |-
    <em>"Love potion?</em> " said Moody.
10956:
  text: |-
    "Not of the standard sort. It is meant to trigger a two-way bond with an
    unbearably sweet Veela woman named Verdandi who the Headmaster hopes might be
    able to redeem even him, if they truly loved each other."
10957:
  text: |-
    "<em>Gah!</em> " said Moody. "That bloody sentimental fool -"
10958:
  text: |-
    "Agreed," Severus Snape said calmly, his attention focused on his work.
10959:
  text: |-
    "Tell me you've at least got some Malaclaw venom in there."
10960:
  text: |-
    "Second flask."
10961:
  text: |-
    "Iocane powder."
10962:
  text: |-
    "Either the fourteenth or fifteenth bottle."
10963:
  text: |-
    "Bahl's Stupefaction," Moody said, naming an extremely addictive narcotic with
    interesting side effects on people with Slytherin tendencies; Moody had once
    seen an addicted Dark Wizard go to ridiculous lengths to get a victim to lay
    hands on a certain exact portkey, instead of just having someone toss the target
    a trapped Knut on their next visit to town; and after going to all that work,
    the addict had gone to the <em>further</em> effort to lay a <em>second
    Portus,</em> on the <em>same portkey,</em> which had, on a second touch,
    transported the victim back to safety. To this day, even taking the drug into
    account, Moody could not imagine what could have possibly been going through the
    man's mind at the time he had cast the second Portus.
10964:

    "Tenth vial," said Snape.
10965:
  text: |-
    "Basilisk venom," offered Moody.
10966:
  text: |-
    "<em>What?</em> " spat Snape. "Snake venom is a positive component of the
    resurrection potion! Not to mention that it would dissolve the bone and all the
    other substances! And where would <em>we</em> even get -"
10967:
  text: |-
    "Calm down, son, I was just checking to see if you could be trusted."
10968:
  text: |-
    Mad-Eye Moody continued his (secretly unnecessary) slow turning, surveying the
    graveyard, and the Potions Master continued pouring.
10969:
  text: |-
    "Hold on," Moody said suddenly. "How do you know <em>this</em> is really where
    -"
10970:
  text: |-
    "Because it says 'Tom Riddle' on the easily moved headstone," Snape said dryly.
    "And I have just won ten Sickles from the Headmaster, who bet you would think of
    that before the fifth bottle. So much for constant vigilance."
10971:
  text: |-
    There was a pause.
10972:
  text: |-
    "How long did it take Albus to reali-"
10973:
  text: |-
    "Three years after we learned of the ritual," said Snape, in a tone not quite
    like his usual sardonic drawl. "In retrospect, we should have consulted you
    earlier."
10974:
  text: |-
    Snape uncapped the ninth bottle.
10975:
  text: |-
    "We poisoned all the other graves as well, with long-lasting substances,"
    remarked the former Death Eater. "It <em>is</em> possible that we are in the
    correct graveyard. He may not have planned this far ahead back when he was
    slaughtering his family, and he cannot move the grave itself -"
10976:
  text: |-
    "The true location doesn't look like a graveyard any more," Moody said flatly.
    "He moved all the <em>other</em> graves here and Memory-Charmed the Muggles. Not
    even Bellatrix Black would be told anything about that until just before the
    ritual started. <em>No one</em> knows the true location now except him."
10977:

    They continued their futile work.

    The Slytherin common room could be accurately and precisely described as a
    remilitarized zone; the moment you stepped through the portrait hole you would
    see that the left half of the room was Definitely Not Talking to the right half
    and vice versa. It was very clear, it did not need to be explained to anyone,
    that you did <em>not</em> have the option of <em>not taking sides</em>.

10985:
  text: |-
    If you went high enough in Hogwarts, you didn't see many other people around,
    just corridors and windows and staircases and the occasional portrait, and now
    and then some interesting sight, such as a bronze statue of a furry creature
    like a small child, holding a peculiar flat spear...
10986:
  text: |-
    If you went high enough in Hogwarts, you didn't see many other people around,
    which suited Harry.
10987:
  text: |-
    There were much worse places to be trapped, Harry supposed. In fact you probably
    couldn't think of anywhere <em>better</em> to be trapped than an ancient castle
    with a fractal ever-changing structure that meant you couldn't ever run out of
    places to explore, full of interesting people and interesting books and
    incredibly important knowledge unknown to Muggle science.
10988:
  text: |-
    If Harry hadn't been told that he <em>couldn't</em> leave, he probably would've
    <em>jumped</em> at the chance to spend more time in Hogwarts, he would've
    plotted and connived to get it. Hogwarts was literally <em>optimal,</em> not in
    all the realms of possibility maybe, but certainly on the real planet Earth, it
    was the Maximum Fun Location.
10989:
  text: |-
    How could the castle and its grounds seem so much smaller, so much more
    confining, how could the rest of the world become so much more interesting and
    important, the instant Harry had been told that he wasn't allowed to leave? He'd
    spent <em>months</em> here and hadn't felt claustrophobic <em>then.</em>
10990:

    <em>You</em> know <em>the research on this,</em> observed some part of himself,

    the next county in order to buy huge loads of phosphate detergent, and surveys
    showed that they rated phosphate detergents as gentler and more effective and
    even easier-pouring... and if you give two-year-olds a choice between a toy in

    toy in the open and go for the one behind the barrier... salespeople know that

    it was all in Cialdini's book</em> Influence, <em>everything you're feeling
    right now, the grass is always greener on the side that's not allowed.</em>
10991:

    If Harry hadn't been told that he couldn't leave, he probably would've

10992:

    Who knew whether there <em>was</em> still a Dark Lord Voldemort for him to

    Who knew whether He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named still existed outside of the
    imagination of a possibly-not-just-pretending-to-be-crazy old wizard?
10996:
  text: |-
    Lord Voldemort's body had been found burned to a crisp, there couldn't really be
    such things as souls. How could Lord Voldemort still be alive? How did
    Dumbledore <em>know</em> that he was alive?
10997:
  text: |-
    And if there wasn't a Dark Lord, Harry couldn't defeat him, and he would be
    trapped in Hogwarts forever.
10998:
  text: |-
    ...maybe he would be legally allowed to escape after he graduated his seventh
    year, six years and four months and three weeks from now. It wasn't
    <em>that</em> long as lengths of time went, it only <em>seemed</em> like long
    enough for protons to decay.
10999:
  text: |-
    Only it wasn't <em>just</em> that.

    It wasn't <em>just</em> Harry's freedom that was at stake.
11001:
  text: |-
    The Headmaster of Hogwarts, the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, the Supreme
    Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards, was quietly sounding the
    alarm.
11002:
  text: |-
    A <em>false</em> alarm.
11003:
  text: |-
    A false alarm which <em>Harry</em> had triggered.
11004:
  text: |-
    <em>You know,</em> said the part of him that refined his skills, <em>didn't you
    sort of ponder, once, how every different profession has a different way to be
    excellent, how an excellent teacher isn't like an excellent plumber; but they
    all have in common certain methods of not being stupid; and that one of the most
    important such techniques is to face up to your little mistakes before they turn
    into BIG mistakes?</em>
11005:
  text: |-
    ...although this already seemed to qualify as a BIG mistake, actually...
11006:
  text: |-
    <em>The point being,</em> said his inner monitor, <em>it's getting worse
    literally by the minute. The way spies turn people is, they get them to commit a
    little sin, and then they use the little sin to blackmail them into a bigger
    sin, and then they use THAT sin to make them do even bigger things and then the
    blackmailer owns their soul.</em>
11007:
  text: |-
    <em>Didn't you once think about how the person being blackmailed, if they could
    foresee the whole path, would just decide to take the punch on the first step,
    take the hit of exposing that first sin? Didn't you decide that you would do
    that, if anyone ever tried to blackmail you into doing something major in order
    to conceal something little? Do you see the similarity here, Harry James Potter-
    Evans-Verres?</em>
11008:
  text: |-
    Only it wasn't little, it already wasn't little, there would be a lot of very
    powerful people extremely angry at Harry, not just for the false alarm but for
    <em>freeing Bellatrix from Azkaban,</em> if the Dark Lord <em>did</em> exist and
    did come after him later, that war might already be lost -
11009:
  text: |-
    <em>You don't think they'll be impressed by your honesty and rationality and
    foresight in stopping this before it snowballs even further?</em>
11010:
  text: |-
    Harry did <em>not</em>, in fact, think this; and after a moment's reflection,
    whichever part of himself he was talking to, had to agree that this was absurdly
    optimistic.
11011:
  text: |-
    His wandering feet took him near an open window, and Harry went over, and leaned
    his arms on the ledge, and stared down at the grounds of Hogwarts from high
    above.
11012:
  text: |-
    Brown that was barren trees, yellow that was dead grass, ice-colored ice that
    was frozen creeks and frozen streams... whichever school official had dubbed it
    'The Forbidden Forest' really hadn't understood marketing, the name just made
    you want to go there even more. The sun was sinking in the sky, for Harry had
    been thinking for some hours now, thinking mostly the same thoughts over and
    over, but with key differences each time, like his thoughts were not going in
    circles, but climbing a spiral, or descending it.
11013:
  text: |-
    He still couldn't believe that he'd gone through the <em>entire</em> thing with
    Azkaban - he'd switched off his Patronus before it took all his life, he'd
    stunned an Auror, he'd figured out how to hide Bella from the Dementors, he'd
    faced down twelve Dementors and scared them away, he'd invented the rocket-
    assisted broomstick, and ridden it - he'd gone through the <em>entire</em> thing
    without ever <em>once</em> rallying himself by thinking, <em>I have to do
    this... because... I promised Hermione I'd come back from lunch!</em> It felt
    like an irrevocably missed opportunity; like, having done it wrong <em>that</em>
    time, he would never be able to get it <em>right</em> no matter what sort of
    challenge he faced next time, or what promise he made. Because then he would
    just be doing it awkwardly and deliberately to make up for having missed it the
    <em>first</em> time around, instead of making the heroic declarations he
    could've made if he'd remembered his promise to Hermione. Like that one wrong
    turn was irrevocable, you only got one chance, had to do it right on the first
    try...
11014:
  text: |-
    He should've remembered that promise to Hermione <em>before</em> going to
    Azkaban.
11015:
  text: |-
    Why had he decided to do that, again?
11016:
  text: |-
    <em>My working hypothesis is that you're stupid,</em> said Hufflepuff.
11017:
  text: |-
    <em>That is not a useful fault analysis,</em> thought Harry.
11018:
  text: |-
    <em>If you want a little more detail,</em> said Hufflepuff, <em>the Defense
    Professor of Hogwarts was all like 'Let's get Bellatrix Black out of Azkaban!'
    and you were like 'Okay!'</em>
11019:
  text: |-
    <em>Hold on, THAT'S not fair -</em>
11020:
  text: |-
    <em>Hey,</em> said Hufflepuff, <em>notice how, once you're all the way up here,
    and the individual trees sort of blur together, you can actually see the shape
    of the forest?</em>
11021:
  text: |-
    Why <em>had</em> he done it...?
11022:
  text: |-
    Not because of any cost-benefit calculation, that was for sure. He'd been too
    embarrassed to pull out a sheet of paper and start calculating expected
    utilities, he'd worried that Professor Quirrell would stop respecting him if he
    said no or even hesitated too much to help a maiden in distress.
11023:
  text: |-
    He'd thought, somewhere deep inside him, that if your mysterious teacher offered
    you the first mission, the first chance, the call to adventure, and you said
    <em>no</em>, then your mysterious teacher walked away from you in disgust, and
    you never got another chance to be a hero...
11024:
  text: |-
    ...yeah, that had been it. In retrospect, that had been it. He'd gone and
    started thinking his life had a plot and here was a plot twist, as opposed to,
    oh, say, here was a proposal to <em>break Bellatrix Black out of Azkaban.</em>
    That had been the true and original reason for the decision in the split second
    where it had been made, his brain perceptually recognizing the narrative where
    he said 'no' as dissonant. And when you thought about it, that wasn't a rational
    way to make decisions. Professor Quirrell's ulterior motive to obtain the last
    remains of Slytherin's lost lore, before Bellatrix died and it was irrevocably
    forgotten, seemed impressively sane by comparison; a benefit commensurate with
    what had appeared at the time as a small risk.
11025:
  text: |-
    It didn't seem fair, it didn't seem <em>fair</em>, that <em>this</em> was what
    happened if he lost his grip on his rationality for just a tiny fraction of a
    second, the tiny fraction of a second required for his brain to decide to be
    more comfortable with 'yes' arguments than 'no' arguments during the discussion
    that had followed.
11026:
  text: |-
    From high above, far enough above that the individual trees blurred together,
    Harry stared out at the forest.
11027:
  text: |-
    Harry <em>didn't</em> want to confess and ruin his reputation forever and get
    everyone angry at him and maybe end up killed by the Dark Lord later. He'd
    rather be trapped in Hogwarts for six years than face that. That was how he
    felt. And so it was in fact helpful, a relief, to be able to cling to a single
    decisive factor, which was that if Harry confessed, Professor Quirrell would go
    to Azkaban and die there.
11028:
  text: |-
    (A catch, a break, a stutter in Harry's breathing.)
11029:
  text: |-
    If you phrased it <em>that</em> way... why, you could even pretend to be a hero,
    instead of a coward.
11030:
  text: |-
    Harry lifted his eyes from the Forbidden Forest, looked up at the clear blue
    forbidden sky.
11031:
  text: |-
    Stared out the glass panes at the big bright burning thing, the fluffy things,
    the mysterious endless blue in which they were embedded, that strange new
    unknown place.
11032:
  text: |-
    It... actually did help, it helped quite a lot, to think that his own troubles
    were nothing compared to being in Azkaban. That there were people in the world
    who were <em>really</em> in trouble and Harry Potter was not one of them.
11033:
  text: |-
    What was he going to do about Azkaban?
11034:
  text: |-
    What was he going to do about magical Britain?
11035:
  text: |-
    ...which side was he on, now?
11036:
  text: |-
    In the bright light of day, everything that Albus Dumbledore had said certainly
    <em>sounded</em> a lot wiser than Professor Quirrell. Better and brighter, more
    moral, more <em>convenient,</em> wouldn't it be nice if it were true. And the
    thing to remember was that Dumbledore believed things <em>because</em> they
    sounded nice, but Professor Quirrell was the one who was <em>sane</em>.
11037:
  text: |-
    (Again the catch in his breathing, it happened each time he thought of Professor
    Quirrell.)
11038:
  text: |-
    But just because something sounded nice, didn't make it <em>wrong,</em> either.
11039:
  text: |-
    And if the Defense Professor <em>did</em> have a flaw in his sanity, it was that
    his outlook on life was <em>too negative.</em>
11040:
  text: |-
    <em>Really?</em> inquired the part of Harry that had read eighteen million
    experimental results about people being too optimistic and overconfident.
    <em>Professor Quirrell is too pessimistic? So pessimistic that his expectations
    routinely</em> undershoot <em>reality? Stuff him and put him in a museum, he's
    unique. Which one of you two planned the perfect crime, and</em> then <em>put in
    all the error margin and fallbacks that ended up saving your butt,</em> just in
    case <em>the perfect crime went wrong? Hint hint, his name wasn't Harry
    Potter.</em>
11041:
  text: |-
    But "pessimistic" wasn't the correct word to describe Professor Quirrell's
    problem - if a problem it truly was, and not the superior wisdom of experience.
    But to Harry it looked like Professor Quirrell was constantly interpreting
    everything in the worst possible light. If you handed Professor Quirrell a glass
    that was 90% full, he'd tell you that the 10% empty part proved that no one
    <em>really</em> cared about water.
11042:
  text: |-
    That was a very good analogy, now that Harry thought about it. Not all of
    magical Britain was like Azkaban, that glass was well over half full...
11043:
  text: |-
    Harry stared up at the bright blue sky.
11044:
  text: |-
    ...although, <em>following</em> the analogy, if Azkaban existed, then maybe it
    <em>did</em> prove that the 90% good part was there for other reasons, people
    trying to <em>make a show of kindness</em> as Professor Quirrell had put it. For
    if they were truly kind they would not have made Azkaban, they would storm the
    fortress to tear it down... wouldn't they?
11045:
  text: |-
    Harry stared up at the bright blue sky. If you wanted to be a rationalist you
    had to read an awful lot of papers on flaws in human nature, and some of those
    flaws were innocent logical failures, and some of them looked a lot darker.
11046:
  text: |-
    Harry stared up at the bright blue sky, and thought of the Milgram experiment.
11047:
  text: |-
    Stanley Milgram had done it to investigate the causes of World War II, to try to
    understand why the citizens of Germany had obeyed Hitler.
11048:
  text: |-
    So he had designed an experiment to investigate <em>obedience,</em> to see if
    Germans were, for some reason, more liable to obey harmful orders from authority
    figures.
11049:
  text: |-
    First he'd run a pilot version of his experiment on American subjects, as a
    control.
11050:
  text: |-
    And afterward he hadn't bothered trying it in Germany.
11051:
  text: |-
    Experimental apparatus: A series of 30 switches set in a horizontal line, with
    labels starting at '15 volts' and going up to '450 volts', with labels for each
    group of four switches. The first group of four labeled 'Slight Shock', the
    sixth group labeled 'Extreme Intensity Shock', the seventh group labeled
    'Danger: Severe Shock', and the two last switches left over labeled just 'XXX'.
11052:
  text: |-
    And an actor, a confederate of the experimenter, who had appeared to the true
    subjects to be someone just like them: someone who had answered the same ad for
    participants in an experiment on learning, and who had lost a (rigged) lottery
    and been strapped into a chair, along with the electrodes. The true experimental
    subjects had been given a slight shock from the electrodes, just so that they
    could see that it worked.
11053:
  text: |-
    The true subject had been told that the experiment was on the effects of
    punishment on learning and memory, and that part of the test was to see if it
    made a difference what sort of person administered the punishment; and that the
    person strapped to the chair would try to memorize sets of word pairs, and that
    each time the 'learner' got one wrong, the 'teacher' was to administer a
    successively stronger shock.
11054:
  text: |-
    At the 300-volt level, the actor would stop trying to call out answers and begin
    kicking at the wall, after which the experimenter would instruct the subjects to
    treat non-answers as wrong answers and continue.
11055:
  text: |-
    At the 315-volt level the pounding on the wall would be repeated.
11056:
  text: |-
    After that nothing would be heard.
11057:
  text: |-
    If the subject objected or refused to press a switch, the experimenter,
    maintaining an impassive demeanor and dressed in a gray lab coat, would say
    'Please continue', then 'The experiment requires that you continue', then 'It is
    absolutely essential that you continue', then 'You have no other choice, you
    <em>must</em> go on'. If the fourth prod still didn't work, the experiment
    halted there.
11058:
  text: |-
    Before running the experiment, Milgram had described the experimental setup, and
    then asked fourteen psychology seniors what percentage of subjects <em>they</em>
    thought would go all the way up to the 450-volt level, what percentage of
    subjects would press the last of the two switches marked XXX, after the victim
    had stopped responding.
11059:
  text: |-
    The most pessimistic answer had been 3%.
11060:
  text: |-
    The actual number had been 26 out of 40.
11061:
  text: |-
    The subjects had sweated, groaned, stuttered, laughed nervously, bitten their
    lips, dug their fingernails into their flesh. But at the experimenter's
    prompting, they had, most of them, gone on administering what they believed to
    be painful, dangerous, possibly lethal electrical shocks. All the way to the
    end.
11062:
  text: |-
    Harry could hear Professor Quirrell laughing, in his mind; the Defense
    Professor's voice saying something along the lines of: <em>Why, Mr. Potter, even
    I had not been so cynical; I knew men would betray their most cherished
    principles for money and power, but I did not realize that a stern look also
    sufficed.</em>
11063:
  text: |-
    It was dangerous, to try and guess at evolutionary psychology if you weren't a
    professional evolutionary psychologist; but when Harry had read about the
    Milgram experiment, the thought had occurred to him that situations like this
    had probably arisen many times in the ancestral environment, and that most
    potential ancestors who'd tried to disobey Authority were dead. Or that they
    had, at least, done less well for themselves than the obedient. People
    <em>thought</em> themselves good and moral, but when push came to shove, some
    switch flipped in their brain, and it was suddenly a lot harder to heroically
    defy Authority than they thought. Even if you could do it, it wouldn't be easy,
    it wouldn't be some effortless display of heroism. You would tremble, your voice
    would break, you would be afraid; would you be able to defy Authority even then?
11064:
  text: |-
    Harry blinked, then; because his brain had just made the connection between
    Milgram's experiment and what Hermione had done on her first day of Defense
    class, she'd refused to shoot a fellow student, even when Authority had told her
    that she must, she had trembled and been afraid but she had still refused. Harry
    had seen that happen right in front of his own eyes and he still hadn't made the
    connection until now...
11065:
  text: |-
    Harry stared down at the reddening horizon, the Sun was sinking lower, the sky
    fading, darkening, even if most of it was still blue, soon it would turn to
    night. The gold and red colors of Sun and sunset reminded him of Fawkes; and
    Harry wondered, for a moment, if it must be a sad thing to be a phoenix, and
    call and cry and scream without being heeded.
11066:
  text: |-
    But Fawkes would never give up, as many times as he died he would always be
    reborn, for Fawkes was a being of light and fire, and despairing over Azkaban
    belonged to the darkness just as much as did Azkaban itself.
11067:
  text: |-
    If you were given a glass half-empty and half-full, then that was the way
    reality was, that was the truth and it was so; but you still had a choice of how
    to <em>feel</em> about it, whether you would despair over the empty half or
    rejoice in the water that was there.
11068:
  text: |-
    Milgram had tried certain other variations on his test.
11069:

    In the eighteenth experiment, the experimental subject had only needed to call
    out the test words to the victim strapped into the chair, and record the
    answers, while someone <em>else</em> pressed the switches. It was the same
    apparent suffering, the same frantic pounding followed by silence; but it wasn't
    <em>you</em> pressing the switch. <em>You</em> just watched it happen, and read
    the questions to the person being tortured.
11070:
  text: |-
    37 of 40 subjects had continued their participation in that experiment to the
    end, the 450-volt end marked 'XXX'.
11071:
  text: |-
    And if you were Professor Quirrell, you might have decided to feel cynical about
    that.
11072:
  text: |-
    But 3 out of 40 subjects had <em>refused</em> to participate all the way to the
    end.
11073:
  text: |-
    The Hermiones.
11074:
  text: |-
    They did exist, in the world, the people who wouldn't fire a Simple Strike Hex
    at a fellow student even if the Defense Professor ordered them to do it. The
    ones who had sheltered Gypsies and Jews and homosexuals in their attics during
    the Holocaust, and sometimes lost their lives for it.
11075:
  text: |-
    And were those people from some other species than humanity? Did they have some
    extra gear in their heads, some additional chunk of neural circuitry, which
    lesser mortals did not possess? But that was not likely, given the logic of
    sexual reproduction which said that the genes for complex machinery would be
    scrambled beyond repair, if they were not universal.
11076:
  text: |-
    Whatever parts Hermione was made from, everyone had those same parts inside them
    somewhere...
11077:
  text: |-
    ...well, that was a nice thought but it wasn't <em>strictly</em> true, there was
    such a thing as literal brain damage, people could <em>lose</em> genes and the
    complex machine could stop working, there were sociopaths and psychopaths,
    people who lacked the gear to care. Maybe Lord Voldemort had been born like
    that, or maybe he had known good and yet still chosen evil; at this point it
    didn't matter in the slightest. But a <em>supermajority</em> of the population
    ought to be capable of learning to do what Hermione and Holocaust resisters did.
11078:
  text: |-
    The people who had been run through the Milgram experiment, who had trembled and
    sweated and nervously laughed as they went all the way to pressing the switches
    marked 'XXX', many of them had written to thank Milgram, afterward, for what
    they had learned about themselves. That, too, was part of the story, the legend
    of that legendary experiment.
11079:
  text: |-
    The Sun had almost sunk below the horizon now, a last golden tip peeking above
    the faraway tops of trees.
11080:
  text: |-
    Harry looked at it, that tip of Sun, his glasses were supposed to be proof
    against UV so he ought to be able to look directly at it without damaging his
    eyes.
11081:
  text: |-
    Harry stared directly at it, that tiny fraction of the Light that was not
    obscured and blocked and hidden, even if it was only 3 parts out of 40, the
    other 37 parts were there somewhere. The 7.5% of the glass that was full, which
    proved that people really did care about water, even if that force of caring
    within themselves was too often defeated. If people truly didn't care, the glass
    would have been truly empty. If everyone had been like You-Know-Who inside,
    secretly cleverly selfish, there would have been no resisters to the Holocaust
    at all.
11082:
  text: |-
    Harry looked at the sunset, on the second day of the rest of his life, and knew
    that he had switched sides.
11083:
  text: |-
    Because he couldn't believe in it any more, he couldn't really, not after going
    to Azkaban. He couldn't do what 37 out of 40 people would vote for him to do.
    Everyone might have inside them what it took to be Hermione, and someday they
    might learn; but <em>someday</em> wasn't <em>now</em>, not here, not today, not
    in the real world. If you were on the side of 3 out of 40 people then you
    weren't a political majority, and Professor Quirrell had been right, Harry would
    not bow his head in submission when that happened.
11084:
  text: |-
    There was a sort of awful appropriateness to it. You shouldn't go to Azkaban and
    come back having not changed your mind about anything important.
11085:
  text: |-
    <em>So is Professor Quirrell right, then?</em> asked Slytherin. <em>Leaving out
    whether he's good or evil, is he</em> right? <em>Are you, to them, whether they
    know it or not, their next Lord? We'll just leave out the Dark part, that's him
    being cynical again. But is it your intention now to rule? I've got to say, that
    makes even</em> me <em>nervous.</em>
11086:
  text: |-
    <em>Do you think you can be trusted with power?</em> said Gryffindor. <em>Isn't
    there some sort of rule that people who want power shouldn't have it? Maybe we
    should make Hermione the ruler instead.<br/></em>
11087:
  text: |-
    <em>Do you think you're fit to run a society and not have it collapse into total
    chaos inside of three weeks flat?</em> said Hufflepuff. <em>Imagine how loudly
    Mum would scream if she'd heard you'd been elected Prime Minister, now ask
    yourself, are you sure she's wrong about that?</em>
11088:
  text: |-
    <em>Actually,</em> said Ravenclaw, <em>I have to point out that all this
    political stuff sounds overwhelmingly boring. How about if we leave all the
    electioneering to Draco and stick to science? It's what we're actually good at,
    and that's been known to improve the human condition too, y'know.</em>
11089:
  text: |-
    <em>Slow down,</em> thought Harry at his components, <em>we don't have to decide
    everything right now. We're allowed to ponder the problem as fully as possible
    before coming to a solution.</em>
11090:
  text: |-
    The last part of the Sun sank below the horizon.
11091:
  text: |-
    It was strange, this feeling of not quite knowing who you were, which side you
    were on, of having <em>not already made up your mind</em> about something as
    major as that, there was an unfamiliar sensation of freedom in it...
11092:
  text: |-
    And that reminded him of what Professor Quirrell had said to his last question,
    which reminded him of Professor Quirrell, which made it hard once more to
    breathe, started that burning sensation in Harry's throat, sent his thoughts
    around that loop of the climbing spiral once again.
11093:
  text: |-
    Why was he so sad, now, whenever he thought of Professor Quirrell? Harry was
    used to knowing himself, and he didn't know why he felt so sad...
11094:
  text: |-
    It felt like he'd lost Professor Quirrell forever, lost him in Azkaban, that was
    how it felt. As surely as if the Defense Professor had been eaten by Dementors,
    consumed in the empty voids.
11095:
  text: |-
    <em>Lost him! Why did I lose him? Because he said Avada Kedavra and there was in
    fact a perfectly good reason even though I didn't see it for a couple of hours?
    Why can't things go back to the way they were?</em>
11096:
  text: |-
    But then it hadn't <em>been</em> the Avada Kedavra. That might have played a
    part in irreversibly collapsing a structure of rationalizations and flinches and
    carefully not thinking about certain things. But it hadn't been the Avada
    Kedavra, that hadn't been the disturbing thing that Harry had seen.
11097:
  text: |-
    <em>What did I see...?</em>
11098:
  text: |-
    Harry looked at the fading sky.
11099:
  text: |-
    He'd seen Professor Quirrell turn into a hardened criminal while facing the
    Auror, and the apparent change of personalities had been effortless, and
    complete.
11100:
  text: |-
    Another woman had known the Defense Professor as 'Jeremy Jaffe'.
11101:
  text: |-
    <em>How many different people are you, anyway?</em>
11102:
  text: |-
    <em>I cannot say that I bothered keeping count.</em>
11103:
  text: |-
    You couldn't help but wonder...
11104:
  text: |-
    ...whether 'Professor Quirrell' was just one more name on the list, just one
    more person that had been <em>turned into</em>, made up in the service of some
    unguessable goal.
11105:
  text: |-
    Harry would always be wondering now, every time he talked to Professor Quirrell,
    if it was a mask, and what motive was behind that mask. With every dry smile,
    Harry would be trying to see what was pulling the levers on the lips.
11106:
  text: |-
    <em>Is that how other people will start thinking of me, if I get too Slytherin?
    If I pull off too many plots, will I never be able to smile at anyone again,
    without them wondering what I really mean by it?</em>
11107:
  text: |-
    Maybe there was some way to restore a trust in surface appearances and make a
    normal human relationship possible again, but Harry couldn't think of what it
    might be.
11108:
  text: |-
    That was how Harry had lost Professor Quirrell, not the person, but the...
    connection...
11109:
  text: |-
    Why did that hurt so much?
11110:
  text: |-
    Why did it feel so lonely, now?
11111:
  text: |-
    Surely there were other people, maybe better people, to trust and befriend?
    Professor McGonagall, Professor Flitwick, Hermione, Draco, not to mention Mum
    and Dad, it wasn't like Harry was <em>alone...</em>
11112:
  text: |-
    Only...
11113:
  text: |-
    A choking sensation grew in Harry's throat as he understood.
11114:
  text: |-
    Only Professor McGonagall, Professor Flitwick, Hermione, Draco, they all of them
    sometimes knew things that Harry didn't, but...
11115:
  text: |-
    They did not excel above Harry <em>within</em> his own sphere of power; such
    genius as they possessed was not like his genius, and his genius was not like
    theirs; he might look upon them as peers, but not look <em>up</em> to them as
    his <em>superiors.</em>
11116:
  text: |-
    None of them had been, none of them could ever be...
11117:
  text: |-
    Harry's mentor...
11118:
  text: |-
    That was who Professor Quirrell had been.
11119:
  text: |-
    That was who Harry had lost.
11120:
  text: |-
    And the manner in which he had lost his first mentor might or might not allow
    Harry to ever get him back. Maybe someday he would know all Professor Quirrell's
    hidden purposes and the doubts between them would go away; but even if that
    seemed possible, it didn't seem very probable.
11121:
  text: |-
    There was a gust of wind, outside Hogwarts, it bent the empty trees, rippled the
    lake whose heart was still unfrozen, made a whispering sound as it slid past the
    window that looked upon the half-twilit world, and Harry's thoughts wandered
    outward for a time.
11122:
  text: |-
    Then returned inward again, to the next step of the spiral.
11123:
  text: |-
    <em>Why am I different from the other children my age?</em>
11124:
  text: |-
    If Professor Quirrell's answer to that had been an evasion, then it was a very
    well-calculated one. Deep enough and complex enough, sufficiently full of
    suggestions of hidden meaning, to serve as a trap for a Ravenclaw who couldn't
    be diverted by less. Or maybe Professor Quirrell had meant his answer honestly.
    Who knew what motive might have pulled that lever on those lips?
11125:
  text: |-
    <em>I will say this much, Mr. Potter: You are already an Occlumens, and I think
    you will become a perfect Occlumens before long. Identity does not mean, to such
    as us, what it means to other people. Anyone we can imagine, we can be; and the
    true difference about you, Mr. Potter, is that you have an unusually good
    imagination. A playwright must contain his characters, he must be larger than
    them in order to enact them within his mind. To an actor or spy or politician,
    the limit of his own diameter is the limit of who he can pretend to be, the
    limit of which face he may wear as a mask. But for such as you and I, anyone we
    can imagine, we can</em> be, <em>in reality and not pretense.</em> <em>While you
    imagined yourself a child, Mr. Potter, you</em> were <em>a child. Yet there are
    other existences you could support, larger existences, if you wished. Why are
    you so free, and so great in your circumference, when other children your age
    are small and constrained? Why can you imagine and</em> become <em>selves more
    adult than a mere child of a playwright should be able to compose? That I do not
    know, and I must not say what I guess. But what you have, Mr. Potter, is
    freedom.</em>
11126:
  text: |-
    If that was a snow job it was one heck of a distracting one.
11127:
  text: |-
    And the still more worrisome thought was that Professor Quirrell hadn't
    <em>realized</em> how disturbed Harry would be, how <em>wrong</em> that speech
    would sound to him, how much damage it would do to his trust in Professor
    Quirrell.
11128:
  text: |-
    There ought to always be one real person who you <em>truly</em> were, at the
    center of everything...
11129:
  text: |-
    Harry stared out at the falling night, the gathering darkness.
11130:
  text: |-
    ...right?
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
11131:
  text: |-
    It was almost bedtime when Hermione heard the scattered intakes of breath and
    looked up from her copy of <em>Beauxbatons: A History</em> to see the missing
    boy, the boy who had been misplaced at lunch that Sunday, whose dinner
    nonappearance had been accompanied by rumors - and she hadn't believed them
    because they were <em>completely ridiculous</em>, but she'd felt a little
    queasiness inside - that he'd withdrawn from Hogwarts in order to hunt down
    Bellatrix Black.
11132:
  text: |-
    "<em>Harry!</em> " she shrieked, she didn't even realize that she was talking
    directly to him for the first time in a week, or notice how some other students
    started at the sound of her yelling all the way across the Ravenclaw common
    room.
11133:
  text: |-
    Harry's eyes had already lifted to her, he was already walking toward her, so
    she stopped halfway out of her chair -
11134:
  text: |-
    A few moments later, Harry was seated across from her, and he was putting away
    his wand after casting a Quieting barrier around them.
11135:
  text: |-
    (And an awful lot of Ravenclaws were trying not to look like they were
    watching.)
11136:
  text: |-
    "Hey," Harry said. His voice wavered. "I missed you. You're... going to talk to
    me again, now?"
11137:
  text: |-
    Hermione nodded, she just nodded, she couldn't think of what to say. She'd
    missed Harry too, but she was realizing, with a guilty sort of feeling, that it
    might've been a lot worse for him. She had other friends, Harry... it didn't
    feel <em>fair</em>, sometimes, that Harry talked to only her like that, so that
    she <em>had</em> to talk to him; but Harry had a look about him like unfair
    things had been happening to <em>him</em>, too.
11138:
  text: |-
    "What's been going <em>on?</em> " she said. "There's all sorts of rumors. There
    were people saying you'd run off to fight Bellatrix Black, there were people
    saying you'd run off to <em>join</em> Bellatrix Black -" and <em>those</em>
    rumors had said that Hermione had just made up the thing about the phoenix, and
    she'd yelled that the whole Ravenclaw common room had seen it, so then the next
    rumor had claimed she'd made up <em>that</em> part too, which was stupidity of
    such an inconceivable level that it left her <em>completely flabbergasted.</em>
11139:
  text: |-
    "I can't talk about it," Harry said in a bare whisper. "Can't talk about a lot
    of it. I wish I could tell you everything," his voice wavered, "but I can't... I
    guess, if it helps or anything, I'm not going to lunch with Professor Quirrell
    any more..."
11140:
  text: |-
    Harry put his hands over his face, then, covering his eyes.
11141:
  text: |-
    Hermione felt the queasy feeling all through her stomach.
11142:
  text: |-
    "Are you crying?" said Hermione.
11143:
  text: |-
    "Yeah," said Harry, his voice sounding a little breathy. "I don't want anyone
    else to see."
11144:
  text: |-
    There was a little silence. Hermione wanted to help but she didn't know what to
    do about a boy crying, and she didn't know what was happening; she felt like
    huge things were happening around her - no, around Harry - and if she knew what
    they were she would probably be scared, or alarmed, or something, but she didn't
    know anything.
11145:
  text: |-
    "Did Professor Quirrell do something wrong?" she said at last.
11146:
  text: |-
    "That's not why I can't go to lunch with him any more," Harry said, still in
    that bare whisper with his hands pressed over his eyes. "That was the
    Headmaster's decision. But yeah, Professor Quirrell said some things to me that
    made me trust him less, I guess..." Harry's voice sounded very shaky. "I'm
    feeling kind of alone right now."
11147:
  text: |-
    Hermione put her hand on her cheek where Fawkes had touched her yesterday. She'd
    kept thinking about that touch, over and over, maybe because she <em>wanted</em>
    it to be important, to mean something to her...
11148:
  text: |-
    "Is there any way I can help?" she said.
11149:
  text: |-
    "I want to do something normal," Harry said from behind his hands. "Something
    very normal for first-year Hogwarts students. Something eleven-year-olds and
    twelve-year-olds like us are <em>supposed</em> to do. Like play a game of
    Exploding Snap or something... I don't suppose you have the cards or know the
    rules or anything like that?"
11150:
  text: |-
    "Um... I <em>don't</em> know the rules, actually..." said Hermione. "I know they
    <em>explode</em>."
11151:
  text: |-
    "I don't suppose Gobstones?" said Harry.
11152:
  text: |-
    "Don't know the rules and they <em>spit</em> at you. Those are <em>boy</em>
    games, Harry!"
11153:
  text: |-
    There was a pause. Harry ground his hands against his face to wipe it, and then
    took his hands away; and then he was looking at her, looking a little helpless.
    "Well," Harry said, "what <em>do</em> wizards and witches our age do, when they
    play, you know, the kind of pointless silly games we're <em>supposed</em> to
    play at this age?"
11154:
  text: |-
    "Hopscotch?" said Hermione. "Jump-rope? Unicorn attack? <em>I</em> don't know,
    <em>I</em> read books!"
11155:
  text: |-
    Harry started laughing, and Hermione started giggling along with him even though
    she didn't know quite why, but it <em>was</em> funny.
11156:
  text: |-
    "I guess that helped a little," said Harry. "Actually I think it helped more
    than playing Gobstones for an hour could've possibly helped, so thanks for being
    you. And no matter what, I'm <em>not</em> having anyone Obliviate everything I
    know about calculus. I'd sooner die."

        If I had to take a guess, Harry has just been confronted with a multitude of
        horrors that he'd previously been ignorant of, that he had to defeat entirely
        by himself. He's just been forced to grow up in a devastating way, and here he
        really wants to find something childish and normal to get a little bit back of
        what he lost. He's also probably wondering if he'd be happier if he was more
        innocent and less intelligent, but a minute of honest interaction with his
        best friend reaffirms to him that he will be fine, and that his intelligence
        and education are parts of him that he doesn't want to ever give up.

    Harry stood up from the table, and there was a rush of restored background noise
    as his rise broke the Quieting Charm. "I'm a tad sleepy so I'm going off to
    bed," Harry said, now his voice was ordinary and wry, "I've got some lost time
    to make up for, but I'll see you at breakfast, and then at Herbology, if that's

    There was a parchment, and a deck of playing cards.

    <em>A little bird told me that Dumbledore has shut the door of your cage.</em>

    Well, he'd <em>already</em> picked up the parchment, which could just as easily
    have been enchanted with a trap, if a trap was involved.

    But still.

    "Wingardium Leviosa," Harry whispered, and Hovered the packet of cards to lie
    next to where his alarm clock rested in a pocket of the headboard. He'd deal
    with it tomorrow.

    And then Harry lay back in bed, and closed his eyes, to dream without any
    phoenix to protect him, and pay his reckoning.

    He came awake with a gasp of horror, not a scream, he'd yet to scream this
    night, but his blanket was all tangled around him from where his sleeping form
    had jerked as he dreamed of running, trying to get away from the gaps in space
    that were pursuing him through a corridor of metal lit by dim gaslight, an
    endlessly long corridor of metal lit by dim gaslight, and he hadn't
    <em>known</em>, in the dream, that touching those voids meant he would die
    horribly and leave his still-breathing body empty behind him, all he'd known was
    that he had to run and run and run from the wounds in the world sliding after
    him -

    Harry started to cry again, it wasn't for the horror of the chase, it was that
    he'd run away while someone behind him was screaming for help, screaming for him
    to come back and save her, help her, she was being eaten, she was going to die,
    and in the dream Harry had run away instead of helping her.

    <em>"DON'T GO!" The voice came in a scream from behind the metal door. "No, no,
    no, don't go, don't take it away, don't don't don't -"</em>

    Why had Fawkes ever rested on his shoulder? He'd walked away. Fawkes should hate
    him.
11187:
  text: |-
    Fawkes should hate Dumbledore. <em>He'd</em> walked away.
11188:

    Fawkes should hate everyone -

    The boy wasn't awake, wasn't dreaming, his thoughts were jumbled and confused in
    the shadowlands that bordered sleep and waking, unprotected by the safety rails
    that his aware mind imposed on itself, the careful rules and censors. In that
    shadowland his brain had woken up enough to think, but something else was too
    sleepy to act; his thoughts ran free and wild, unconstrained by his self-
    concept, his waking self's ideals of what he shouldn't think. That was the
    freedom of his brain's dreams, as his self-concept slept. Free to repeat, over
    and over, Harry's new worst nightmare:

    <em>"No, I didn't mean it, please don't die!"</em>

    <em>"No, I didn't mean it, please don't die!"</em>

    <em>"No, I didn't mean it, please don't die!"</em>

    A rage grew in him alongside the self-loathing, a terrible hot wrath / icy cold
    hatred, for the world which had done that to her / for himself, and in his half-
    awake state Harry fantasized escapes, fantasized ways out of the moral dilemma,
    he imagined himself hovering above the vast triangular horror of Azkaban, and
    whispering an incantation unlike any syllables that had ever been heard before
    on Earth, whispers that echoed all the way across the sky and were heard on the
    other side of the world, and there was a blast of silver Patronus fire like a
    nuclear explosion that tore apart all the Dementors in an instant and ripped
    apart the metal walls of Azkaban, shattered the long corridors and all the dim
    orange lights, and then a moment later his brain remembered that there were
    people in there, and rewrote the half-dream fantasy to show all the prisoners
    laughing as they flew away in flocks from the burning wreck of Azkaban, the
    silver light restoring the flesh to their limbs as they flew, and Harry started
    crying harder into his pillow, because he couldn't do it, because he wasn't God
    -

    He'd sworn upon his life and magic and his art as a rationalist, he'd sworn by
    all he held sacred and all his happy memories, he'd given his oath so now he had
    to do something, <em>had to do something, had to DO SOMETHING -</em>
11195:
  text: |-
    Maybe it was pointless.
11196:
  text: |-
    Maybe trying to follow rules was pointless.
11197:
  text: |-
    Maybe you just burned down Azkaban however.
11198:
  text: |-
    And in fact he'd sworn he'd do it, so now that was what he had to do.
11199:
  text: |-
    He'd just do whatever it took to get rid of Azkaban, that was all. If that meant
    ruling Britain, fine, if that meant finding a spell to whisper that would echo
    all across the sky, whatever, the important thing was to destroy Azkaban.
11200:
  text: |-
    That was the side he was on, that was who he was, so there, it was done.
11201:

    His waking mind would have demanded a lot more details before accepting that as
    an answer, but in his half-dreaming state it felt like enough of a resolution to
    let his tired mind fall truly asleep again, and dream the next nightmare.

    <em>Final Aftermath:</em>
11203:
  text: |-
    She came awake with a gasp of horror, a disruption of her breathing that left
    her feeling deprived of air and yet her lungs didn't move, she woke up with an
    unvoiced scream on her lips and no words, no words came forth, for she could not
    understand what she had seen, <em>she could not understand what she had
    seen</em>, it was too large for her to encompass and still taking shape, she
    could not put words to that formless shape and so she could not discharge it,
    could not discharge it and become innocent and unknowing once more.

    "What time is it?" she whispered.
11205:

    Her golden jeweled alarm clock, the beautiful and magical and expensive alarm
    clock that the Headmaster had given her as a gift upon her employment at
    Hogwarts, whispered back, "Around two in the morning. Go back to sleep."
11206:
  text: |-
    Her sheets were soaked in sweat, her nightclothes soaked in sweat, she took her
    wand from beside the pillow and cleaned herself up before she tried to go back
    to sleep, she tried to go back to sleep and eventually succeeded.

    Sybill Trelawney went back to sleep.
