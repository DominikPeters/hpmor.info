    Broomsticks had been invented during what a Muggle would have called the Dark
    Ages, supposedly by a legendary witch named Celestria Relevo, allegedly the
    great-great-granddaughter of Merlin.
10078:
  text: |-
    Celestria Relevo, or whichever person or group had really invented those
    enchantments, hadn't known a darned thing about Newtonian mechanics.
10079:
  text: |-
    Broomsticks, therefore, worked by Aristotelian physics.
10080:
  text: |-
    They went where you pointed them.
10081:
  text: |-
    If you wanted to move straight forward, you pointed them straight forward; you
    didn't worry about keeping some of the thrust going downward to cancel out the
    effect of gravity.
10082:
  text: |-
    If you turned a broomstick, all of its new velocity was in the new direction of
    pointing, it didn't go sideways based on its old momentum.
10083:
  text: |-
    Broomsticks had maximum speeds, not maximum accelerations. Not because of
    anything to do with air resistance, but because a broomstick had some maximum
    Aristotelian impetus its enchantments could exert.
10084:
  text: |-
    Harry had never explicitly <em>noticed</em> that before, despite being dextrous
    enough to get the best grades in flying class. Broomsticks worked so much like
    the human mind <em>instinctively expected them to work</em> that his brain had
    managed to <em>entirely overlook their physical absurdity.</em> Harry, on his
    first Thursday of broomstick lessons, had been distracted by more interesting-
    seeming phenomena, words written on paper and a glowing red ball. So his brain
    had simply suspended its disbelief, marked the reality of broomsticks as
    accepted, and proceeded to have its fun, without ever once <em>thinking of the
    question</em> whose answer would have been obvious. For it is a sad fact that we
    only ever <em>think</em> about a tiny fraction of all the phenomena we
    encounter...
10085:
  text: |-
    That is the story of how Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres was almost killed by
    his own lack of curiosity.
10086:
  text: |-
    Because rockets did <em>not</em> work by Aristotelian physics.
10087:
  text: |-
    Rockets did <em>not</em> work like a human mind instinctively thought a flying
    thing should work.
10088:
  text: |-
    A rocket-assisted broomstick, therefore, did <em>not</em> move like the magical
    broomsticks upon which Harry was such a very good flyer.
10089:
  text: |-
    None of this actually went through Harry's mind at the time.
10090:
  text: |-
    For one thing, the loudest noise he'd ever heard in his life was preventing him
    from hearing himself think.
10091:
  text: |-
    For another thing, accelerating upward at four gravities meant that he had
    around two and a half seconds, total, to go from the bottom to the top of
    Azkaban.
10092:
  text: |-
    And even if they were two and a half of the <em>longest</em> seconds in the
    history of Time, that wasn't enough room to do much thinking.
10093:
  text: |-
    There was time only to see the lights of the Aurors' curses arrowing down at
    him, slightly angle the broomstick to avoid them, realize that the broomstick
    was simply continuing on with mostly the same momentum instead of going in the
    direction he pointed it, and activate the wordless concepts
10094:
  text: |-
    *<em>crap*</em>
10095:
  text: |-
    and
10096:
  text: |-
    <em>*Newton*</em>
10097:
  text: |-
    whereupon Harry angled the broomstick much harder and then they started to very
    quickly approach the wall so he angled it back the other way and there were more
    lights coming down and the Dementors were sliding smoothly up toward them along
    with some kind of giant winged creature of white-golden flame so Harry wrenched
    the broomstick back toward the sky but now he was still sliding toward another
    wall so he tilted the broom slightly and he stopped approaching but he was too
    close so he tilted it again and then the distant Aurors on their broomsticks
    weren't very distant at all and he was going to crash into that woman so he spun
    his broomstick straight away from her and then in another instant he realized
    his rocket was an extremely powerful flamethrower and in a fraction of a second
    it would be pointing directly at the Auror so he spun the broomstick sideways as
    he kept going up and he couldn't remember if it was pointing at any Aurors now
    but at least it wasn't pointing at <em>her</em>
10098:
  text: |-
    Harry missed another Auror by about a meter, zipping past him on a sideways-
    pointed flamethrower moving upward at, Harry would later guess, around 300
    kilometers per hour.
10099:
  text: |-
    If there were any screams of roasted Aurors he didn't hear them, but this was
    not evidence one way or another, because all that Harry was hearing at the
    moment was an extremely loud noise.
10100:
  text: |-
    A couple of <em>calmer if not quieter</em> seconds later, there didn't seem to
    be any Aurors around, or any Dementors, or any giant winged flame creatures, and
    the vast and terrible edifice of Azkaban looked surprisingly tiny from this
    height.
10101:
  text: |-
    Harry got the broomstick pointed toward the Sun, faintly visible through the
    clouds, it wasn't high in the sky at this time of day and month of winter, and
    the broomstick accelerated for another two seconds in that direction and picked
    up an amazing amount of speed very quickly before the solid-fuel rocket burned
    itself out.
10102:
  text: |-
    After that, once Harry could hear himself think again, when there was only the
    howling wind from their ridiculous speed, and Harry's enchantment-assisted
    fingers gripping the broomstick were merely resisting the decelerating drag of
    moving way faster than terminal velocity, <em>that</em> was when Harry actually
    thought all that stuff about Newtonian mechanics and Aristotelian physics and
    broomsticks and rocketry and the importance of curiosity and how he was never
    going to do anything this Gryffindor ever again or at least not until after he
    learned the Dark Lord's secret of immortality and <em>why</em> had he listened
    to Professor Quirinus "<em>I asssure you, boy, I would not attempt thisss if I
    did not anticipate my own ssurvival</em> " Quirrell instead of Professor Michael
    "Son, if you try anything to do with rockets on your own, I mean <em>anything
    whatsoever</em> without a trained professonal watching, you will die and that
    will make Mum sad" Verres-Evans.

    "<em>WHAT?</em> " shrieked Amelia at the mirror.
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
10104:
  text: |-
    The wind had died down to a bearable level as the air resistance slowed them,
    giving Harry plenty of opportunity to listen to the buzzing, ringing sound that
    seemed to fill his whole brain.
10105:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell had been supposed to cast a Quieting Charm on the rocket
    exhaust... apparently there were limits to what Quieting Charms could do... in
    retrospect, Harry should have Transfigured a pair of earplugs, not just trusted
    to the Quieting Charm, though that probably wouldn't have been enough either...
10106:
  text: |-
    Well, magical healing probably had something to treat permanent hearing damage.
10107:
  text: |-
    No, really, magical healing probably had something to treat that. He'd seen
    students go to Madam Pomfrey with injuries that sounded a lot worse...
10108:
  text: |-
    <em>Is there some way of transplanting an imaginary personality to someone
    else's head?</em> asked Hufflepuff. <em>I don't want to live in yours
    anymore.</em>
10109:
  text: |-
    Harry shoved it all into the back of his mind, there really wasn't anything he
    could do about it right now. Was there anything he <em>should</em> be worrying
    about -
10110:
  text: |-
    Then Harry glanced behind him, remembering for the first time to check whether
    Bellatrix or Professor Quirrell had been blown off the broomstick.
10111:
  text: |-
    But the green snake was still in its harness, and the emaciated woman was still
    clinging to the broomstick, her face still charged with unhealthy color and her
    eyes still bright and dangerous. Her shoulders were shaking like she was
    laughing hysterically, and her lips were moving as though to shout, but no sound
    was coming out -
10112:
  text: |-
    Oh, right.
10113:
  text: |-
    Harry took off the hood of his cloak, tapped his ears to let her know he
    couldn't hear.
10114:
  text: |-
    Whereupon Bellatrix grasped her wand, pointed it at Harry, and suddenly the
    ringing in his ears diminished, he could hear her.
10115:
  text: |-
    A moment later he regretted it; the imprecations she was screaming at Azkaban,
    Dementors, Aurors, Dumbledore, Lucius, Bartemy Couch, something called the Order
    of the Phoenix, and all who stood in the way of her Dark Lord, et cetera, were
    not suitable for younger and more sensitive listeners; and her laughter was
    hurting his newly healed ears.
10116:
  text: |-
    "Enough, Bella," Harry finally said, and her voice stopped on the instant.
10117:
  text: |-
    There was a pause. Harry pulled the Cloak back over his head, just on general
    principles; and realized in the same instant that they might have telescopes
    down there or something, in retrospect pulling down his hood for even a moment
    had been an incredibly dumb move, he hoped the whole mission didn't end up
    failing because of that one error...
10118:
  text: |-
    <em>We're not really cut out for this, are we?</em> observed Slytherin.
10119:
  text: |-
    <em>Hey,</em> Hufflepuff objected in sheer reflex, <em>we can't expect to do
    anything perfectly the first time, we probably just need more practice FORGET I
    SAID THAT.</em>
10120:
  text: |-
    Harry looked back again, saw Bellatrix looking around with a puzzled, wondering
    look on her face. Her head kept turning, turning.
10121:
  text: |-
    And finally Bellatrix said, her voice now lower, "My Lord, where are we?"
10122:
  text: |-
    <em>What do you mean?</em> was what Harry wanted to say, but the Dark Lord would
    never admit to not understanding anything, so Harry replied, dryly, "We are on a
    broomstick."
10123:
  text: |-
    <em>Does she think she's dead, that this is Heaven?</em>
10124:
  text: |-
    Bellatrix's hands were still chained to the broomstick, so it was only a finger
    that came up and pointed when she said, "What is <em>that?</em> "
10125:
  text: |-
    Harry followed the direction of her finger and saw... nothing in particular,
    actually...
10126:
  text: |-
    Then Harry realized. After they'd gone up high enough, there hadn't been any
    clouds to obscure it any more.
10127:
  text: |-
    "That is the Sun, dear Bella."
10128:
  text: |-
    It came out remarkably controlled, the Dark Lord sounding perfectly calm and
    maybe a little impatient with her, even as the tears started down Harry's
    cheeks.
10129:
  text: |-
    In the endless cold, in the pitch blackness, the Sun would surely have been...
10130:
  text: |-
    A happy memory...
10131:
  text: |-
    Bellatrix's head kept turning.
10132:
  text: |-
    "And the fluffy things?" she said.
10133:
  text: |-
    "Clouds."
10134:
  text: |-
    There was a pause, and then Bellatrix said, "But what <em>are</em> they?"
10135:
  text: |-
    Harry didn't answer her, there was no way his voice could have been steady,
    would have been steady, it was all he could do to keep his breathing perfectly
    regular while he cried.
10136:
  text: |-
    After a while, Bellatrix breathed, so softly Harry almost didn't hear,
    "Pretty..."
10137:
  text: |-
    Her face slowly relaxed, the color leaving its paleness almost as quickly as it
    had arrived.
10138:
  text: |-
    Her skeletal body slumped down against the broomstick.
10139:
  text: |-
    The borrowed wand dangled lifelessly from the strap attached to her unmoving
    hand.
10140:
  text: |-
    <em>YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING -</em>
10141:
  text: |-
    Harry's mind remembered then, the Pepper-Up potion came at a cost; Bellatrix
    would <em>ssleep for a conssiderable time,</em> Professor Quirrell had said.
10142:
  text: |-
    And in the same instant another part of Harry became utterly convinced, looking
    back at the chalk-white emaciated woman, seeming deader in the bright sunlight
    than anything Harry had ever seen alive, that she <em>was</em> dead, that she
    had just uttered her last word, that Professor Quirrell had misjudged the dosage
    -
10143:
  text: |-
    - or deliberately sacrificed Bellatrix to guard their own escape -
10144:
  text: |-
    <em>Is she breathing?</em>
10145:
  text: |-
    Harry couldn't see if she was breathing.
10146:
  text: |-
    There was no way, on the broomstick, to reach back and take her pulse.
10147:
  text: |-
    Harry looked ahead to make sure they weren't about to run into any flying rocks,
    kept on steering the broomstick toward the Sun, the invisible boy and the
    possibly dead woman riding off into the afternoon, while his fingers gripped the
    wood so hard they turned white.
10148:
  text: |-
    He couldn't reach back and perform artificial respiration.
10149:
  text: |-
    He couldn't use anything from his healer's kit.
10150:
  text: |-
    <em>Trust Professor Quirrell to have not endangered her?</em>
10151:
  text: |-
    Strange, it was strange, that even genuinely believing that Professor Quirrell
    hadn't meant to kill the Auror (for it <em>would</em> have been stupid),
    thinking of the Defense Professor's reassurances no longer felt reassuring.
10152:
  text: |-
    Then it occurred to Harry that he had yet to check -
10153:
  text: |-
    Harry looked back, and hissed, "<em>Teacher?</em> "
10154:
  text: |-
    The snake did not stir within its harness, and said no word.
10155:
  text: |-
    ...maybe the snake, not being an actual rider, hadn't been protected from the
    acceleration. Or maybe coming that close to the Dementors without a shield, even
    for a moment in Animagus form, had knocked out the Defense Professor.
10156:
  text: |-
    That wasn't good.
10157:
  text: |-
    It was to have been Professor Quirrell who told Harry when it was safe to use
    the portkey.
10158:
  text: |-
    Harry steered the broomstick with whitened fingers, and thought, he thought very
    hard for a small unmeasured length of time, during which Bellatrix might or
    might not have been breathing, during which Professor Quirrell himself might
    have already been not-breathing for a while.
10159:
  text: |-
    And Harry decided that while it was possible to recover from the error of
    wasting the portkey in his possession, it was not possible to recover from the
    error of letting a brain go too long without oxygen.
10160:
  text: |-
    So Harry took the next portkey in the sequence from his pouch, as he slowed his
    broomstick to a halt in the bright blue air (Harry didn't know, when he thought
    about it, whether a portkey's ability to adjust for the Earth's rotation also
    included the ability to match velocity in general with its new surroundings),
    touched the portkey to the broomstick, and...
10161:
  text: |-
    Harry paused, still holding the twig, the mate of the twig he had snapped what
    seemed like two weeks ago. He was feeling a sudden reluctance; his brain seemed
    to have learned the rule, by some purely neural process of operant conditioning,
    that Snapping Twigs Is A Bad Idea.
10162:
  text: |-
    But that wasn't actually logical, so Harry snapped the twig anyway.

    There was a thunderous boom from behind the nearby metal door, causing Amelia to
    drop the mirror she was holding and spin around with her wand in hand, and then
    that door burst open to reveal Albus Dumbledore, standing there in front of a
    great smoking hole in the prison wall.
10164:
  text: |-
    "Amelia," said the old wizard. There was no trace of any of his customary
    levity, his eyes were hard as sapphires beneath his half-moon glasses. "I must
    leave Azkaban and I must do so <em>now</em>. Is there any faster way than a
    broomstick to get beyond the wards?"
10165:
  text: |-
    "No -"
10166:
  text: |-
    "Then I require your fastest broomstick, at once!"
10167:
  text: |-
    The place where Amelia <em>wanted</em> to be was with the Auror who had been
    injured by that Fiendfyre or whatever it had been.
10168:
  text: |-
    What she <em>needed</em> to do was find out what Dumbledore knew.
10169:
  text: |-
    "You!" the old witch barked at the team around her. "Keep clearing the corridors
    until you're at bottom, they may not all have escaped yet!" And then, to the old
    wizard, "Two broomsticks. You can brief me once we're in the air."
10170:
  text: |-
    There was a match of stares, but not a long one.
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
10171:
  text: |-
    A sickeningly hard yank caught at Harry's abdomen, considerably harder than the
    yank that had transported him to Azkaban, and this time the distance traversed
    was great enough that he could hear an instant of silence, watch the unseeable
    space between spaces, in the crack between one place and another.
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
10172:
  text: |-
    The Sun, which had shone on the two only briefly, was swiftly occluded by a
    raincloud as they shot away from Azkaban, in the direction of the wind and
    faster than the wind.
10173:
  text: |-
    "Who's behind it?" shouted Amelia to the broomstick flying a pace away from her.
10174:
  text: |-
    "One of two people," Dumbledore said back, "I know not, at this instant, who. If
    the first, then we are in trouble. If the second, we are all in far greater
    trouble."
10175:
  text: |-
    Amelia didn't spare any breath for sighs. "When will you know?"
10176:
  text: |-
    The old wizard's voice was grim, quiet and yet somehow rising above the wind.
    "Three things they need for perfection, if it is that one: The flesh of the Dark
    Lord's most faithful servant, the blood of the Dark Lord's greatest foe, and
    access to a certain grave. I had thought Harry Potter safe, with their attempt
    on Azkaban all but failed - though I still set guards upon him - but now I am
    fearful indeed. They have access to Time, someone with a Time-Turner is sending
    messages for them; and I suspect the kidnap attempt on Harry Potter has already
    taken place some hours ago. Which is why <em>we</em> have not heard about it,
    being in Azkaban where Time cannot knot itself. That past came after our own
    future, you see."
10177:
  text: |-
    "And if it is the other?" shouted Amelia. What she had heard already was
    worrying enough; that sounded like the darkest of Dark rituals, and centering on
    the dead Dark Lord himself.
10178:
  text: |-
    The old wizard, his face now even grimmer, said nothing, only shook his head.
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
10179:
  text: |-
    When the portkey's yank had subsided, the Sun was only just peeking over the
    horizon, looking more like dawn than sunset, as their broom hovered low above a
    brief expanse of dark-orange rock and sand, arranged into lumpy hills like
    someone had kneaded the land's dough a few times and then forgotten to roll it
    flat. In the near distance, waves rolled past in an endless vista of water,
    though the ground over which the broomstick hovered was above sea level by
    meters at the least.
10180:
  text: |-
    Harry blinked at the dawn colors, and then realized the portkey had been
    international.
10181:
  text: |-
    "Oy!" came a brisk, female shout from behind him, and Harry spun the broomstick
    to look. A middle-aged lady was holding up one hand to her mouth in a deliberate
    calling gesture, and bustling forward. Her kindly features, narrow eyes, and
    umber skin marked a race unfamiliar to Harry; she was clad in brilliant purple
    robes of a style Harry had never seen before; and when her lips opened again she
    spoke with an accent that Harry couldn't place, for he was not widely traveled.
    "Where were you? You're two hours late! I almost gave up on the lot of you...
    hello?"
10182:
  text: |-
    There was a brief pause. Harry's thoughts seemed to be moving oddly, too slow,
    everything felt distant, like there was a thick pane of glass between himself
    and the world, and another thick pane of glass between himself and his feelings,
    so that he could see, but not touch. It had come over him upon seeing the dawn's
    light and the kindly witch, and thinking that it all seemed like a proper end to
    the adventure.
10183:
  text: |-
    Then the witch was rushing forward and drawing her wand; a muttered word severed
    the cuffs that bound the emaciated woman to the broomstick, and Bellatrix was
    being floated down onto the sandy rock with her skeletal arms and pale legs
    dangling like lifeless things. "Oh, Merlin," whispered the witch, "Merlin,
    Merlin, Merlin..."
10184:
  text: |-
    <em>She appears concerned,</em> thought an abstract, distant thing between two
    panes of glass. <em>Is that what a real healer would say, or is it what someone
    told to put on a performance would say?</em>
10185:
  text: |-
    As though it wasn't Harry who spoke, but some other part of himself behind yet
    another pane of glass, a whisper came from his lips. "The green snake on her
    back is an Animagus." Not high the whisper, not cold, only quiet. "He is
    unconscious."
10186:
  text: |-
    The witch's head twitched up, to look at where that voice had seemed to speak
    out of empty air, and then looked back down at Bellatrix. "You're not Mister
    Jaffe."
10187:
  text: |-
    "That would be the Animagus," whispered Harry's lips. <em>Oh,</em> thought the
    Harry behind glass, listening to the sound of his own lips, <em>that makes
    sense; Professor Quirrell must have used a different name.</em>
10188:
  text: |-
    "Since when is <em>he</em> a - bah, forget it." The witch laid her wand on the
    snake's nose for a moment, then shook her head sharply. "Nothing wrong with him
    that a day's rest won't cure. <em>Her...</em>"
10189:
  text: |-
    "Can you wake him up now?" whispered Harry's lips. <em>Is that a good idea?</em>
    thought Harry, but his lips definitely seemed to think so.
10190:
  text: |-
    Again the sharp headshake. "If an Innervate didn't work on him -" began the
    witch.
10191:
  text: |-
    "I did not attempt one," whispered Harry's lips.
10192:
  text: |-
    "What? Why - oh, never mind. <em>Innervate.</em>"
10193:
  text: |-
    There was a pause, and then a snake slowly crawled out of its harness. Slowly
    the green head came up, looked around.
10194:
  text: |-
    A blur later, Professor Quirrell was standing, and a moment later had sagged to
    his knees.
10195:
  text: |-
    "Lie down," said the witch without looking up from Bellatrix. "That you in
    there, Jeremy?"
10196:
  text: |-
    "Yes," said the Defense Professor rather hoarsely, as he carefully laid himself
    down on a relatively flat patch of sandy orange rock. He was not so pale as
    Bellatrix, but his face was bloodless in the dim dawn light. "Salutations, Miss
    Camblebunker."
10197:
  text: |-
    "I told you," said the witch, sharpness in her voice and a slight smile on her
    face, "call me Crystal, this isn't Britain and we'll have none of your formality
    here. <em>And</em> it's Doctor now, not Miss."
10198:
  text: |-
    "My apologies, Doctor Camblebunker." This was followed by a dry chuckle.
10199:
  text: |-
    The witch's smile grew a little wider, her voice that much sharper. "Who's your
    friend?"
10200:
  text: |-
    "You don't need to know." The Defense Professor's eyes were closed, where he lay
    on the ground.
10201:
  text: |-
    "How wrong did it go?"

    Very dryly indeed: "You can read about it tomorrow in any newspaper with an
    international section."

    The witch's wand was tapping here, there, poking and prodding all over
    Bellatrix's body. "I missed you, Jeremy."
10204:
  text: |-
    "Truly?" said the Defense Professor, sounding slightly surprised.
10205:
  text: |-
    "Not even a tiny little bit. If I didn't owe you -"
10206:
  text: |-
    The Defense Professor started to laugh, and then it turned into more of a
    coughing fit.
10207:
  text: |-
    <em>What do you think?</em> said Slytherin to the Inner Critic, while Harry
    listened from behind the glass walls. <em>Performance, or reality?</em>
10208:
  text: |-
    <em>Can't tell,</em> said Harry's Inner Critic. <em>I'm not in top critical form
    right now.</em>
10209:
  text: |-
    <em>Can anyone think of a good probe to gather more information?</em> said
    Ravenclaw.
10210:
  text: |-
    Again that whisper from the empty air above the broomstick: "What is the chance
    of undoing all that was done to her?"
10211:
  text: |-
    "Oh, let's see. Legilimency and unknown Dark rituals, ten years for that to set
    in place, followed by ten years of Dementor exposure? Undo <em>that?</em> You're
    out of your skull, Mister Whoever-You-Are. The question is whether there's
    anything <em>left,</em> and I'd call that maybe one chance in three -" The witch
    suddenly cut herself off. Her voice, when it spoke again, was quieter. "If you
    were her friend, before... then no, you're never getting her back. Best
    understand that now."
10212:
  text: |-
    <em>I'm voting that this is a performance,</em> said the Inner Critic. <em>She
    wouldn't just blurt all that out in response to one question unless she was
    looking for an opportunity.</em>
10213:
  text: |-
    <em>Noted, but I'm putting a low weight of confidence on that,</em> said
    Ravenclaw. <em>It's very hard not to let your suspicions control your
    perceptions when you're trying to weigh evidence that subtle.</em>
10214:
  text: |-
    "What potion did you give her?" the witch said after opening Bellatrix's mouth
    and peering inside, her wand flashing multiple colors of illumination.
10215:
  text: |-
    The man lying on the ground calmly said, "Pepper-Up -"
10216:
  text: |-
    "<em>Were you out of your mind?</em> "
10217:
  text: |-
    Again the coughing laugh.
10218:
  text: |-
    "She'll sleep for a week if she's lucky," the witch said, and clucked her
    tongue. "I'll owl you when she opens her eyes, I suppose, so you can come back
    and talk her into that Unbreakable Vow. Have you got anything to stop her from
    killing me on the spot, if she manages to even move for another month?"
10219:
  text: |-
    The Defense Professor, eyes still closed, took a sheet of paper from his robes;
    a moment later, words began to appear on it, accompanied by tiny wisps of smoke.
    When the smoke had stopped rising, the paper floated over toward the woman.
10220:
  text: |-
    The woman looked over the paper with raised eyebrows, gave a sardonic snort.
    "This had better work, Jeremy, or my last will and testament says that my whole
    estate goes into putting a bounty on your head. Speaking of which -"
10221:
  text: |-
    The Defense Professor reached again into his robes and tossed the witch a bag
    that made a clinking sound. The witch caught it, weighed it, made a pleased
    sound.
10222:
  text: |-
    Then she stood up, and the pale skeletal woman floated off the ground beside
    her. "I'm heading back," said the witch. "I can't start my work here."
10223:
  text: |-
    "Wait," said the Defense Professor, and with a gesture retrieved his wand from
    Bellatrix's hand and harness. Then his hand pointed the wand at Bellatrix, and
    moved in a small circular gesture, accompanied by a quiet, "<em>Obliviate</em>."
10224:
  text: |-
    "<em>That's it</em>," snapped the witch, "I'm taking her out of here before
    anyone does her any more damage -" One arm came around to hug the bony form of
    Bellatrix Black to her side, and they both disappeared with the loud POP! of
    Apparition.
10225:
  text: |-
    And there was silence in that lumpy place, but for the gentle rush of the
    passing waves, and a little breath of wind.
10226:
  text: |-
    <em>I think the performance is finished,</em> said the Inner Critic. <em>I give
    it two and a half out of five stars. She's probably not a very experienced
    actor.</em>
10227:
  text: |-
    <em>I wonder if a real healer would seem more fake than an actor told to play
    one?</em> mused Ravenclaw.<em><br/></em>
10228:
  text: |-
    Like watching a television show, that was how it felt, like watching a
    television show whose characters you didn't particularly empathize with, that
    was all that could be seen and felt from behind the glass walls.
10229:
  text: |-
    Somehow, Harry managed to move his lips himself, send his own voice out into the
    still dawn air, and then was surprised to hear his own question. "How many
    different people are you, anyway?"
10230:
  text: |-
    The pale man lying on the ground didn't laugh, but from the broomstick Harry's
    eyes saw the sides of Professor Quirrell's lips curling up, the edge of that
    familiar sardonic smile. "I cannot say that I bothered keeping count. How many
    are you?"
10231:
  text: |-
    It shouldn't have shaken the inner Harry so much, hearing that response, and yet
    he felt - he felt - unstable, like his own center had been subtracted -
10232:
  text: |-
    Oh.
10233:
  text: |-
    "Excuse me," said Harry's voice. It now sounded as distant and detached as the
    fading Harry felt. "I'm going to faint in a few seconds, I think."
10234:
  text: |-
    "Use the fourth portkey I gave you, the one I said was our fallback refuge,"
    said the man lying on the ground, calmly but swiftly. "It will be safer there.
    And continue wearing your cloak."
10235:
  text: |-
    Harry's free hand retrieved another twig from his pouch and snapped it.
10236:
  text: |-
    There was another portkey yank, internationally long, and then he was somewhere
    black.
10237:
  text: |-
    "<em>Lumos</em>," said Harry's lips, some part of him looking out for the safety
    of the whole.
10238:
  text: |-
    He was inside what looked like a Muggle warehouse, a deserted one.
10239:
  text: |-
    Harry's legs climbed off the broomstick, lay on the floor. His eyes closed, and
    some tidy fraction of self willed his light to fail, before the darkness took
    him.

    "Where will you go?" yelled Amelia. They were almost at the edge of the wards.
10241:
  text: |-
    "Backward in time to protect Harry Potter," said the old wizard, and before
    Amelia could even open her lips to ask if he wanted help, she felt the boundary
    of the wards as they crossed them.
10242:
  text: |-
    There was a pop of Apparition, and the wizard and the phoenix vanished, leaving
    behind the borrowed broomstick.
