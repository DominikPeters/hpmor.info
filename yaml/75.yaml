    It was a looping, meandering alley in the midst of Hogwarts, wandering like a
    stray lock of hair; sometimes crossing itself, it seemed, but you couldn't ever
    get to the end if you gave into the temptation of apparent shortcuts.
12901:
  text: |-
    At the end of the tangle, six students leaned against rough stones, robes black
    against the grey walls and trimmed in green, eyes darting from one to each
    other. Torches burned in the windowless sconce, casting light to ward off the
    darkness and heat to ward off the chill of the Slytherin dungeons.

    "I am <em>certain,</em>" Reese Belka snapped, "absolutely <em>certain,</em> that
    was no true ritual. Little firstie witches can't do that kind of magic, and even
    if they could, who's ever heard of a Dark ritual which <em>sacrifices</em> a
    sealed horror for - <em>that?</em> "
12903:
  text: |-
    "Were you -" said Lucian Bole. "I mean - after that girl snapped her fingers -"
12904:
  text: |-
    Belka's glare should have melted him. "No," she spat, "I was <em>not.</em>"
12905:
  text: |-
    "That is, she wasn't naked," drawled Marcus Flint, his broad shoulders leaning
    back in apparent relaxation against the lumpy stone surface. "Covered in
    chocolate frosting, yes, but not naked."
12906:
  text: |-
    "This day Potter has offered great insult to our Houses," said the grim voice of
    Jaime Astorga.
12907:
  text: |-
    "Yes, well, I'm sorry to be blunt," Randolph Lee said evenly. The seventh-year
    duelist rubbed at his chin, where a faint fuzz of beard had been allowed to
    grow. "But when someone sticks you to the ceiling, it's a message, Astorga. It's
    a message which says: I'm an incredibly powerful Dark Wizard who could've done
    anything to you I damn well pleased, and I don't care if your House is offended,
    either."
12908:
  text: |-
    Robert Jugson III gave a soft, low laugh at this, a chuckle that sent chills
    down several spines. "It makes you wonder if you picked the wrong side, doesn't
    it? I've heard tales about <em>messages</em> like that, sent at the old Dark
    Lord's bidding..."
12909:
  text: |-
    "I'm not ready to kneel to Potter just yet," said Astorga, staring hard into
    Jugson's eyes.
12910:
  text: |-
    "Neither am I," said Belka.
12911:
  text: |-
    Jugson was holding his wand, and he turned it idly back and forth in his
    fingers, pointing it up and then downward. "Are you a Gryffindor or a
    Slytherin?" said Jugson. "Everyone's got a price. Everyone smart."
12912:
  text: |-
    This statement produced a moment of silence.
12913:
  text: |-
    "Shouldn't Malfoy be here?" Bole said tentatively.
12914:
  text: |-
    Flint gave a dismissive flick of his fingers. "Whatever Malfoy's plotting, he
    wants to put on an air of innocence. He can't be seen missing at the same time
    as us."
12915:
  text: |-
    "But everyone <em>knows</em> that already," said Bole. "Even in the other
    Houses."
12916:
  text: |-
    "Yes, very clumsy," said Belka. She snorted. "Malfoy or no, he's just a little
    firstie and we don't need him here."
12917:
  text: |-
    "I will owl my father," Jugson said softly, "and <em>he</em> will speak to Lord
    Malfoy himself -" Abruptly, Jugson stopped speaking.
12918:
  text: |-
    "I don't know about <em>you</em>, dearies," Belka said with fake sweetness, "but
    <em>I</em> don't plan on running scared from a false ritual, and <em>I'm</em>
    not done with Potter and his pet mudblood."
12919:
  text: |-
    Nobody answered. All their gazes were looking past her.
12920:
  text: |-
    Slowly, Belka turned around to see what the others were staring at.
12921:
  text: |-
    "You will do <em>nothing,</em>" hissed their Head of House. Severus Snape's face
    was enraged, when he spoke small spots of spittle flew from his mouth, further
    dotting his already-dirtied robes. "You fools have done <em>enough!</em> You
    have embarrassed my House - <em>lost</em> to first-years - now you speak of
    embroiling noble Lords of the Wizengamot in your <em>pathetic</em> childish
    squabbles? <em>I</em> shall deal with this matter. <em>You</em> will not
    embarrass this House again, you will not <em>risk</em> embarrassing this House
    again! You are <em>done</em> with fighting witches, and if I hear otherwise -"

    If you thought they'd be sitting next to each other at dinnertime, after that,
    you'd be quite mistaken.
12923:
  text: |-
    "What does she <em>want</em> from me?" came the plaintive cry of a boy who, for
    all his extensive reading in the scientific literature, was still a bit naive
    about certain things. "Did she <em>want</em> to get beaten up?"
12924:
  text: |-
    The upper-year Ravenclaw boys who'd sat down next to him at the dinner-table
    exchanged swift glances with each other until, by some unspoken protocol, the
    most experienced of their number spoke.
12925:
  text: |-
    "Look," said Arty Grey, the seventh-year who was leading in their competition by
    three witches and a Defense Professor, "the thing you've got to understand is,
    just because she's <em>angry</em> doesn't mean you lost points. Miss Granger is
    angry because she got all frightened and you're <em>there to be blamed,</em> you
    understand? But at the same time, even though she won't admit it, she'll be
    touched that her boyfriend went to such ridiculous and frankly insane lengths to
    protect her."
12926:
  text: |-
    "This is not about <em>points,</em>" ground out Harry Potter, the words visibly
    escaping from between his clenched teeth. Dinner sat ignored on the table in
    front of him. "This is about <em>justice.</em> And <em>I. Am. Not. Her.
    Boyfriend!</em> "
12927:
  text: |-
    This was met by a certain amount of sniggering from all present.
12928:
  text: |-
    "Yeah, well," said a sixth-year Ravenclaw boy, "I think after she kisses you to
    bring you out of Dementation and you stick forty-four bullies to the ceiling for
    her, we've gone way past 'she's not my girlfriend, really' and into the question
    of what your kids will be like. Wow, that's a scary thought..." The Ravenclaw
    trailed off and then said, in a smaller voice, "Please don't look at me like
    that."
12929:
  text: |-
    "Look," said Arty Grey, "I'm sorry to be blunt about this, but you can have
    justice or you can have girls, you can't have both at the same time." He clapped
    a companionable hand on Harry Potter's shoulder. "You've got potential, kid,
    more potential than any wizard I've ever seen, but you've got to learn how to
    <em>use</em> it, you know? Be a bit sweeter to them, learn some spells to clean
    up that mess you call hair. Above all, you need to hide your evilness better -
    not <em>too</em> well, but better. Nice well-groomed boys get girls, and Dark
    Wizards also get girls, but nice well-groomed boys suspected of being
    <em>secretly</em> Dark get more girls than you can imagine -"
12930:
  text: |-
    "Not interested," Harry said flatly, as he picked up the boy's hand from his
    shoulder and unceremoniously dropped it.
12931:
  text: |-
    "But you will be," said Arty Grey, his voice low and foreboding. "Ah, you will
    be!"
12932:
  text: |-
    Elsewhere along the same table -
12933:
  text: |-
    "<em>Romantic?</em> " shrieked Hermione Granger, so loudly that some of the
    girls next to her winced. "<em>What part of that was romantic?</em> He didn't
    <em>ask!</em> He never <em>asks!</em> He just sends ghosts after people and
    glues them to ceilings and does whatever he wants with <em>my</em> life!"
12934:
  text: |-
    "But don't you see?" said a fourth-year witch. "It means that even though he's
    evil, he <em>loves</em> you!"
12935:
  text: |-
    "You're not helping," said Penelope Clearwater a little further down the table,
    but she was ignored. Several older witches had started toward Hermione, after
    she'd sat down at the extreme opposite end of the table from Harry Potter, but
    then a swifter cloud of younger girls had surrounded Hermione in an impenetrable
    barrier.
12936:
  text: |-
    "Boys," said Hermione Granger, "should not be allowed to love girls without
    asking them first! This is true in a number of ways and especially when it comes
    to gluing people to the ceiling!"
12937:
  text: |-
    This was also ignored. "It's just like a play!" sighed a third-year girl.
12938:
  text: |-
    "A play?" said Hermione. "I'd like to see the play where anything like
    <em>this</em> happens!"
12939:
  text: |-
    "Oh," said the third-year girl, "I was thinking of that really <em>romantic</em>
    one where there's this very nice, sweet boy who makes a Floo call, only he
    mispronounces his destination and stumbles out into this room full of Dark
    Wizards who are performing a forbidden ritual that should've stayed forever lost
    to time, and they're sacrificing seven victims in order to unseal this ancient
    horror which is supposed to grant someone a wish if it's freed, so of course the
    boy's presence interrupts the ritual, and as the horror is eating all the Dark
    Wizards and everyone is dying the boy's last thought is that he wishes he
    could've had a girlfriend, and the next thing you know the boy is lying in the
    lap of this beautiful woman whose eyes are burning with a dreadful light, only
    she doesn't understand anything about being human so the boy always has to stop
    her eating people. This is just like that play, only you're the boy and Harry
    Potter is the girl!"
12940:
  text: |-
    "That..." Hermione said, feeling quite surprised. "That actually <em>does</em>
    sound something like -"
12941:
  text: |-
    "It <em>does?</em> " blurted a second-year girl sitting across the table, who
    was now leaning forward, looking horrified and yet even more fascinated.
12942:
  text: |-
    "No!" said Hermione. "I mean - <em>he's not my boyfriend!</em> "
12943:
  text: |-
    Two seconds later, Hermione's ears caught up with what her lips had just said.
12944:
  text: |-
    The fourth-year witch put her hand on Hermione's shoulder and gave her a
    comforting squeeze. "Miss Granger," she said in a soothing voice, "I think if
    you're really honest with yourself, you'll admit that the real reason you're
    angry with your dark master is that he channeled his unspeakable powers through
    Tracey Davis instead of you."
12945:
  text: |-
    Hermione's mouth opened but her throat locked up before the words came out,
    which was probably a good thing, because if she'd actually yelled that loudly it
    would've broken something.
12946:
  text: |-
    "How's that possible, actually?" said the third-year girl. "I mean for Harry
    Potter to work through another girl even though he's bound himself to you? Do
    the three of you have one of those, you know, arrangements?"
12947:
  text: |-
    "<em>Gaaaaack,</em>" said Hermione Granger, her throat still locked, her brain
    halted, and her vocal cords spontaneously making a noise like she was coughing
    up a yak.

    <em>(Later.)</em>
12949:
  text: |-
    "I don't understand why you're being so <em>unreasonable</em>," said another
    second-year witch, who'd replaced the third-year-girl after Hermione had
    threatened to ask Tracey to eat her soul. "I mean, really, if someone like Harry
    Potter rescued <em>me</em>, I'd be - sending him thank-you cards, and hugging
    him, and," the girl's face was a bit red, "well, kissing him, I'd hope."
12950:
  text: |-
    "Yeah!" said the other second-year witch. "I've never understood why girls in
    plays get <em>angry</em> when the main character goes out of his way to be nice
    to them. <em>I</em> wouldn't act like that if the hero liked <em>me.</em>"
12951:
  text: |-
    Hermione Granger had dropped her head to the dinner table, her hands slowly
    pulling at her hair.
12952:
  text: |-
    "You just don't understand male psychology," the fourth-year witch said in an
    authoritative voice. "Granger's got to make it <em>look</em> like she can
    mysteriously resist his seductive charm."
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
12953:
  text: |-
    <em>(Even later.)</em>
12954:
  text: |-
    And so before long Hermione Granger had turned to the only person left she could
    talk to, the only person guaranteed to understand her point of view -
12955:
  text: |-
    "They're all mad," said Hermione Granger as she strode vigorously toward
    Ravenclaw tower, having left dinner a bit early. "Everyone except you and me,
    Harry, I mean <em>everyone</em> except us in this whole school of Hogwarts,
    they're all entirely <em>mad.</em> And Ravenclaw girls are the <em>worst,</em> I
    don't know <em>what</em> Ravenclaw girls go reading when they get older, but I'm
    certain they ought not to be reading it. One witch asked me if the two of us had
    soul-bonded, which I'm going to look up in the library tonight, but I'm pretty
    sure has never actually happened -"
12956:
  text: |-
    "I don't even know a <em>name</em> for this kind of fallacious reasoning," said
    Harry Potter. The boy was walking normally, which meant he often had to skip
    forward a few steps to match her own indignation-fueled speed. "I seriously
    think if it was up to <em>them</em>, they'd be dragging us off this minute to
    get our names changed to Potter-Evans-Verres-Granger... Ugh, saying that out
    loud makes me realize how awful it sounds."
12957:
  text: |-
    "You mean <em>your</em> name would be Potter-Evans-Verres-Granger and
    <em>mine</em> would be Granger-Potter-Evans-Verres," said Hermione. "It's too
    horrible to imagine."
12958:
  text: |-
    "No," said the boy, "House Potter is a Noble House, so I think that name stays
    in front -"
12959:
  text: |-
    "<em>What?</em> " she said indignantly. "Who says <em>we</em> have to -"
12960:
  text: |-
    There was a sudden awful silence, broken only by the thuds of their shoes.
12961:
  text: |-
    "<em>Anyhow,</em>" Hermione said hastily, "some of the crazy things they said at
    dinner got me thinking, so I just want to say, Harry, that I really am grateful
    to you for saving me and everybody from getting beat up, and even though some
    parts of this afternoon upset me, I'm sure we can just talk about it calmly."
12962:
  text: |-
    "Ah..." Harry said with a faint and tentative smile, his eyes showing a mixture
    of befuddlement and apprehension, "that's... good, I guess?"
12963:
  text: |-
    To be specific, there'd been the fourth-year witch explaining that, since Harry
    was the evil wizard who'd fallen in love with Hermione, and Hermione was the
    pure and innocent girl who would either redeem him or get seduced by the Dark
    Arts herself, it followed that Hermione <em>had</em> to be perpetually indignant
    at anything Harry did, even if it was him heroically saving her from certain
    doom, just so that their romance wouldn't resolve itself before the end of Act
    IV. And <em>then</em> Penelope Clearwater, who Hermione had really thought was
    smarter than that, had remarked in a loud voice that for identical reasons it
    was <em>impossible</em> for Hermione to just go over and talk sensibly with
    Harry about why she was feeling hurt, and anyway Dark Wizards were attracted to
    passionate defiance in a woman, not logic. This was the point at which Hermione
    had shoved herself up from the benches, stomped furiously over to where Harry
    was sitting, and asked him in a reasonable voice if the two of them could go for
    a walk and sort things out.
12964:
  text: |-
    "So in other words," Hermione said in her calmest voice ever, "you're not really
    in trouble with me, I'm still talking to you, we're still friends, and we're
    still studying together. We're <em>not</em> having a fight. Right?"
12965:
  text: |-
    Somehow this only seemed to increase Harry Potter's apprehension. "Right," said
    the Boy-Who-Lived.
12966:
  text: |-
    "Great!" said Hermione. "So, <em>have</em> you worked out why I was upset, Mr.
    Potter?"
12967:
  text: |-
    There was a pause. "You wanted me to keep out of your affairs?" Harry said
    cautiously. "I mean - I know you wanted to do things on your own. And I
    <em>was</em> staying out of your way, until I'd heard you'd gotten ambushed by
    three junior Death Eaters and, honestly, I wasn't expecting that. <em>Professor
    Quirrell</em> wasn't expecting that. I started to worry you'd gotten in over
    your head and then, no offense Hermione, forty-four bullies in a massed ambush
    is way beyond what <em>anyone</em> could handle without help. That's why I
    thought you really needed help just that once -"
12968:
  text: |-
    "No, that part's fine," said Hermione. "We <em>were</em> in over our heads,
    honestly. Please guess again, Mr. Potter."
12969:
  text: |-
    "Um," said Harry. "What Tracey did... startled you?"
12970:
  text: |-
    "Startled me, Mr. Potter?" There might have been a touch of acidity in her
    voice. "No, Mr. Potter, I was <em>scared.</em> I was <em>frightened.</em> I
    wouldn't want to admit to being afraid of just <em>dragons</em> or something,
    people might think I was <em>cowardly</em>, but when you can hear distant voices
    crying 'Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!' and there's pools of blood seeping out from under
    all the doors, then it's okay to be scared."
12971:
  text: |-
    "I <em>am</em> sorry," Harry said with what sounded like genuine regret. "I
    thought you'd realize it was me."
12972:
  text: |-
    "And the <em>reason</em> we all got scared like that, Mr. Potter, was that
    <em>you didn't ask first!</em> " Despite her intentions, Hermione found her
    voice was rising again. "You should've <em>asked</em> me before you did
    something like that, Harry! You should've said very specifically, 'Hermione, can
    I make blood come out from under the doors?' It's important to be specific when
    you're asking about that sort of thing!"
12973:
  text: |-
    The boy rubbed the back of his neck as he walked. "I... honestly, I just thought
    you'd <em>have</em> to say no."
12974:
  text: |-
    "Yes, Mr. Potter, <em>I could've said no</em>. That's <em>the whole point of
    asking first</em>, Mr. Potter!"
12975:
  text: |-
    "No, I mean you'd have <em>had</em> to say no, whether or not it was what you
    <em>really</em> wanted. And then all of you would've gotten beaten up and it
    would've been <em>my</em> fault for asking first."
12976:
  text: |-
    Hermione's eyebrows went up in a bit of surprise, and she kept walking for a few
    steps while she tried to understand this. "What?" she said.
12977:
  text: |-
    "Well..." the boy said a bit slowly. "I mean... you're the Sunshine General,
    aren't you? You <em>couldn't</em> say yes to me scaring people, not even
    bullies, not even to save your friends from getting beaten up. You would've
    <em>had</em> to say no, and then you would've gotten hurt. This way, you can
    tell people honestly that you had no idea and that it wasn't your fault. That's
    why I didn't warn you."
12978:
  text: |-
    Hermione stopped walking, turned to face Harry full on instead of just turning
    her head. Her voice was carefully even as she said, "Harry, you've <em>got</em>
    to stop coming up with clever reasons for doing stupid things."
12979:
  text: |-
    Harry's eyebrows flew up. After a moment he said, "Look... I know what you mean,
    of course, but there's still the question of whether it's actually <em>is</em> a
    good idea, not just a clever one -"
12980:
  text: |-
    "I understand why you did what you did today," Hermione said. "But I want you to
    promise that from now on, you'll ask me first, always, even if you can come up
    with a reason why you shouldn't."
12981:
  text: |-
    There was a pause that stretched, and Hermione could feel her heart sinking.
12982:
  text: |-
    "Hermione -" Harry started to say.
12983:
  text: |-
    "<em>Why?</em> " The frustration burst out into her voice. "<em>Why is it so
    awful? All you have to do is ask!"</em>
12984:
  text: |-
    Harry's eyes were very serious. "Who in S.P.H.E.W. do you try hardest to defend,
    Hermione? Who are you most afraid for, when you fight?"
12985:
  text: |-
    "Hannah Abbott," Hermione said without having to think about it, and then felt a
    little bad, because Hannah <em>was</em> trying hard and she <em>had</em>
    improved a lot -
12986:
  text: |-
    "Would you feel okay about trusting someone else, like Tracey, with
    <em>final</em> responsibility for protecting Hannah? If you knew Hannah was
    about to walk into an ambush, and you came up with a plan for protecting her,
    would you feel good about letting Tracey say whether or not you were allowed to
    do it?"
12987:
  text: |-
    "Well... no?" said Hermione, puzzled.
12988:
  text: |-
    The green eyes of the Boy-Who-Lived were steady on hers. "Would you trust
    <em>Hannah</em> to have the final say in whether she needed protecting?"
12989:
  text: |-
    "I -" said Hermione, and then paused. It was strange, she knew the right answer
    and she also knew the right answer wasn't actually true. Hannah was trying so
    hard to prove she wasn't afraid, even though she <em>was,</em> and it was easy
    to see how the Hufflepuff girl might try <em>too</em> hard -
12990:
  text: |-
    Then Hermione realized the implication. "You think I'm like <em>Hannah?</em> "
12991:
  text: |-
    "Not... exactly..." Harry ran his hands through his mess of hair. "Listen,
    Hermione, what would <em>you</em> have suggested doing, if I'd warned you about
    an ambush by forty-four bullies?"
12992:
  text: |-
    "I would've done the <em>responsible</em> thing and told <em>Professor
    McGonagall</em> and let <em>her</em> take care of it," Hermione said promptly.
    "And <em>then</em> there wouldn't have been darkness and people screaming and
    horrible blue light -"
12993:
  text: |-
    But Harry just shook his head. "That's <em>not</em> the responsible thing to do,
    Hermione. It's what someone playing the <em>role</em> of a responsible girl
    would do. <em>Yes</em>, I thought of going to Professor McGonagall. But she
    would've only stopped the disaster <em>once.</em> Probably before any
    disturbance happened in the first place, like by telling the bullies she knew.
    If the bullies got punished just for plotting, it would be by losing House
    points, or at worst a day's detention, not anything that would really scare
    them. And then the bullies would have <em>tried again</em>. Fewer of them, with
    better operational security so I didn't hear about it. They would probably
    ambush <em>one</em> of you, alone. Professor McGonagall doesn't have the
    <em>authority</em> to do something scary enough to protect you - and
    <em>she</em> wouldn't have overstepped her authority, because she's not really
    responsible."
12994:
  text: |-
    "<em>Professor McGonagall</em> isn't responsible?" Hermione said incredulously.
    She jammed her hands on her hips, now openly glaring at him. "Are you
    <em>nuts?"</em>
12995:
  text: |-
    The boy didn't blink. "You could call it heroic responsibility, maybe," Harry
    Potter said. "Not like the usual sort. It means that whatever happens, no matter
    what, it's <em>always</em> your fault. Even if you tell Professor McGonagall,
    she's not responsible for what happens, <em>you</em> are. Following the school
    rules isn't an excuse, someone else being in charge isn't an excuse, even trying
    your best isn't an excuse. There just aren't any excuses, you've got to <em>get
    the job done no matter what</em>." Harry's face tightened. "That's why I say
    you're not thinking responsibly, Hermione. Thinking that your job is done when
    you tell Professor McGonagall - that isn't heroine thinking. Like Hannah being
    beat up is <em>okay</em> then, because it isn't <em>your fault</em> anymore.
    Being a heroine means your job isn't finished until you've done <em>whatever it
    takes</em> to protect the other girls, <em>permanently.</em>" In Harry's voice
    was a touch of the steel he had acquired since the day Fawkes had been on his
    shoulder. "You can't think as if just following the rules means you've done your
    duty."
12996:
  text: |-
    "I think," Hermione said evenly, "that you and I might disagree about some
    things, Mr. Potter. Like whether you or Professor McGonagall is more
    <em>responsible</em>, and whether being <em>responsible</em> usually involves
    people running around and screaming, and how much it's a good idea to follow
    school rules. And just because we disagree, Mr. Potter, doesn't mean that
    <em>you</em> get the final say."
12997:
  text: |-
    "Well," said Harry, "you asked what was <em>so</em> awful about having to ask
    you first, and it was a surprisingly good question, so I examined my mind and
    that's what I found. I think my real fear is that if Hannah is in trouble and I
    come up with a way to save her that seems weird or dark or something, you might
    not weigh the consequences to Hannah. You might not accept the heroine's
    responsibility of coming up with <em>some</em> way to save her, somehow, no
    matter what. Instead you'd just carry out the <em>role</em> of Hermione Granger,
    the sensible Ravenclaw girl; and the <em>role</em> of Hermione Granger
    automatically says no, whether or not she has a better plan in mind. And then
    forty-four bullies will take turns beating up Hannah Abbott, and it'll all be my
    fault because I <em>knew,</em> even if I didn't want reality to be that way, I
    knew that was how it would go. I'm pretty sure that was my secret, wordless,
    unutterable fear."
12998:
  text: |-
    The frustration was building up inside her again. "It's <em>my</em> life!"
    Hermione burst out. She could imagine what it would be like with Harry messing
    with her all the time, constantly inventing justifications not to ask her first
    and not to listen to her objections. She shouldn't have to <em>win an
    argument</em> just to - "There'll <em>always</em> be some reason, you can
    <em>always</em> say I'm not thinking right! I want my <em>own life!</em>
    Otherwise I'll walk away, I really will, I mean it Harry."
12999:
  text: |-
    Harry sighed. "This is exactly where I didn't want things to end up, and here we
    are. You're afraid of just the same thing I am, aren't you? Afraid that if
    <em>you</em> let go of the steering wheel, we'll crash." The corners of his lips
    twisted, but it didn't look like a real smile. "That's something I can
    understand."
13000:
  text: |-
    "I don't think you understand <em>at all!</em> " Hermione said sharply. "You
    said we'd be <em>partners,</em> Harry!"
13001:
  text: |-
    That stopped him, she could see it stop him.
13002:
  text: |-
    "How about this?" Harry said at last. "I'll promise to ask you first before I do
    anything that could be interpreted as meddling in your affairs. Only
    <em>you've</em> got to promise <em>me</em> to be reasonable, Hermione. I mean
    <em>really</em>, genuinely, stop and think for twenty seconds first, treat it as
    a real choice. The sort of reasonableness where you realize I'm offering a way
    to protect the other girls, and that if you automatically say <em>no</em>
    without considering it properly, there's this <em>actual consequence</em> where
    Hannah Abbott ends up in the hospital."
13003:
  text: |-
    Hermione stared at Harry, as his recitation wound down.
13004:
  text: |-
    "Well?" said Harry.
13005:
  text: |-
    "I shouldn't have to make promises," she said, "just to be <em>consulted</em>
    about <em>my own life.</em>" She turned from Harry and began walking toward the
    Ravenclaw tower, not looking at him. "But I'll think about it, anyway."
13006:
  text: |-
    She heard Harry sigh, and after that they walked in silence for a while, passing
    through an archway of some reddish metal like copper, into a corridor that was
    just like the one they'd left except that it was tiled in pentagons instead of
    squares.
13007:
  text: |-
    "Hermione..." said Harry. "I've been watching you and thinking, since the day
    you said you were going to be a hero. You've <em>got</em> the courage. You'll
    fight for what's right, even in the face of enemies that would scare other
    people away. You've certainly got the raw intelligence for it, and you're
    probably a better person inside than I am. But even so... well, to be honest,
    Hermione... I can't quite see you filling Dumbledore's shoes, leading magical
    Britain's fight against You-Know-Who. Not yet, anyway."
13008:
  text: |-
    Hermione had turned her head to stare at Harry, who just went on walking, as
    though lost in thought. Fill <em>those</em> shoes? She'd never tried to imagine
    herself that way. She'd never <em>imagined</em> imagining herself that way.
13009:
  text: |-
    "And maybe I'm wrong," Harry said as they walked. "Maybe I've just read too many
    stories where the heroes never do the sensible thing and follow the rules and
    tell their Professor McGonagalls, so my brain doesn't think you're a proper
    storybook hero. Maybe it's you who's the sane one, Hermione, and me who's just
    being silly. But every time you talk about following rules or relying on
    teachers, I get that same feeling, like it's bound up with this one last thing
    that's stopping you, one last thing that puts your PC self to sleep and turns
    you into an NPC again..." Harry let out a sigh. "Maybe that's why Dumbledore
    said I should have wicked stepparents."
13010:
  text: |-
    "He said <em>what?</em> "
13011:
  text: |-
    Harry nodded. "I still don't know whether the Headmaster was joking or... the
    thing is, he was <em>right</em> in a way. I <em>had</em> loving parents, but I
    never felt like I could trust their decisions, they weren't <em>sane</em>
    enough. I always knew that if I didn't think things through myself, I might get
    hurt. Professor McGonagall will do whatever it takes to get the job done
    <em>if</em> I'm there to nag her about it, she doesn't break rules on her own
    without heroic supervision. Professor Quirrell really <em>is</em> someone who
    gets things done no matter what, and he's the only other person I know who
    notices stuff like the Snitch ruining Quidditch. But <em>him</em> I can't trust
    to be <em>good</em>. Even if it's sad, I think that's part of the environment
    that creates what Dumbledore calls a hero - people who don't have anyone else to
    shove final responsibility onto, and that's why they form the mental habit of
    tracking everything themselves."<em><br/></em>
13012:
  text: |-
    Hermione didn't say anything to that, but she was thinking back to something
    Godric Gryffindor had written near the end of his very short autobiography.
    Briefly and without any explanation, because the scroll had been meant to be
    copied by hand, centuries before the Muggle printing press had inspired wizards
    to invent the Reading-Writing Quill.
13013:
  text: |-
    <em>No rescuer hath the rescuer,</em> Godric Gryffindor had written. <em>No Lord
    hath the champion, no mother and no father, only nothingness above.</em>
13014:
  text: |-
    If <em>that</em> was the price of being a hero, Hermione wasn't sure she wanted
    to pay it. Or maybe - though it wasn't the sort of thing she would have thought,
    before she started hanging around Harry - maybe Godric Gryffindor had gotten it
    <em>wrong</em>.
13015:
  text: |-
    "Do you trust <em>Dumbledore?"</em> Hermione said. "I mean, he's right here in
    our school and he's the most legendary hero in the whole world -"
13016:
  text: |-
    "He <em>was</em> the most legendary hero," said Harry. "Now he sets chickens on
    fire. Honestly, does Dumbledore seem reliable to <em>you?</em> "
13017:
  text: |-
    Hermione didn't answer.
13018:
  text: |-
    Side by side, the two of them began to climb huge wide spiral stairs, the steps
    alternating between bronze metal and blue stone; the final approach to where the
    Ravenclaw portrait waited to guard their dorm with silly riddles.
13019:
  text: |-
    "Oh, and I just thought of something I should tell you," Harry said when they
    were about halfway up. "Since it affects your life and all. Think of it as a
    sort of down payment -"
13020:
  text: |-
    "What is it?" said Hermione.
13021:
  text: |-
    "I predict S.P.H.E.W. is about to retire."
13022:
  text: |-
    "<em>Retire?</em> " Hermione said, almost stumbling on one of the stairs.
13023:
  text: |-
    "Yeah," Harry said. "I mean, I could be wrong, but I suspect the teachers are
    about to clamp down hard on fighting in the corridors." Harry was grinning as he
    spoke, a glint in his eyes behind the glasses hinting at secret knowledge. "Cast
    new wards to detect offensive hexes, or start verifying reports of bullying
    using Veritaserum - I can think of several ways they might shut it down. But if
    I'm right, it's something to celebrate, Hermione, you and all of you. You kicked
    up enough public ruckus that you got them to actually <em>do</em> something
    about the bullying. <em>All</em> the bullying."
13024:
  text: |-
    Slowly, then, a smile began to creep up her lips, and as she reached the top of
    the stairs and began walking toward the Ravenclaw portrait for her riddle,
    Hermione felt rather lighter on her feet, a wonderful lifting feeling spreading
    through her like she'd been pumped full of helium.
13025:
  text: |-
    Somehow, despite all the effort the eight of them had put in, she hadn't
    expected <em>that</em> much, she hadn't expected it to actually <em>work</em>.
13026:
  text: |-
    They'd made a <em>difference...</em>

13027:
  text: |-
    It was the end of breakfast-time on the next morning.
13028:
  text: |-
    The students from every year sat very still in their benches, all heads turned
    in the same direction, toward the Head Table, before which one lone first-year
    girl stood rigid and motionless, her head tilted back to stare up at the Head of
    House Slytherin.
13029:
  text: |-
    Professor Snape's face was twisted with fury and triumph, vindictive as any
    painting of a Dark Wizard; and behind him the other Professors sat at the Head
    Table, watching with faces as though carved from stone.
13030:
  text: |-
    "- permanently disbanded," spat the Potions Master. "Your self-proclaimed
    Society is <em>outlawed</em> within Hogwarts, by my decision as a Professor! If
    your Society or any member of it is discovered fighting in the hallways again,
    Granger, you will be <em>personally</em> held responsible and expelled, by me,
    from the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!"
13031:
  text: |-
    That first-year girl stood there, before the Head Table where she'd been called
    before only to receive commendations and smiles; stood there with her spine held
    tall and upright in its curve like a centaur's bow, giving nothing to the enemy.
13032:
  text: |-
    That first-year witch stood there with all tears and anger bottled, her face
    still, nothing changing of her outward appearance, while something slowly broke
    inside her, she could feel it breaking.
13033:
  text: |-
    It broke further when Professor Snape gave her two weeks detention for the crime
    of violence in school, sneering with the contemptuous face he'd shown them all
    on the first day of Potions, and with a little twist in the corner of his smile
    that said the Potions Master knew exactly how unfair he was being.
13034:
  text: |-
    Whatever-it-was inside her cracked all the way through, from top to bottom, when
    Professor Snape took one hundred points from Ravenclaw.
13035:
  text: |-
    It ended, then, and Snape told her she was dismissed.
13036:
  text: |-
    She turned around and saw that at the Ravenclaw table, Harry Potter was sitting
    still in his place, she couldn't see his expression from here, she saw his fists
    on the table but she couldn't see if they were clenched white like her own. She
    had whispered to him, when Professor Snape had called her, that he wasn't to do
    anything without asking first.
13037:
  text: |-
    Hermione wheeled back again to look at the Head Table, just as Snape was turning
    away from her to resume his place.
13038:
  text: |-
    "I said you're dismissed, girl," said the sneering voice, but there was a
    pleased smile on Snape's face, like he was waiting for her to do something -
13039:
  text: |-
    Hermione strode forward another five steps toward the Head Table and said in a
    breaking voice, "Headmaster?"
13040:
  text: |-
    Utter silence filled the Great Hall.
13041:
  text: |-
    Headmaster Dumbledore said nothing, didn't move. It was as though he, too, was
    just carved from stone.
13042:
  text: |-
    Hermione turned her gaze to look at Professor Flitwick, whose head, barely
    visible above the table, seemed to be staring down into his lap. Beside him,
    Professor Sprout's face was very tight, she seemed to be forcing herself to
    watch, and her lips were trembling, but she said nothing.
13043:
  text: |-
    Professor McGonagall's chair was empty, the Deputy Headmistress hadn't shown up
    to breakfast that morning.
13044:
  text: |-
    "Why aren't any of you saying anything?" said Hermione Granger. Her voice was
    trembling with the last of her hope, the last desperate reach for help from that
    place inside her. "You <em>know</em> what he's doing is wrong!"
13045:
  text: |-
    "Two more weeks' detention, for insolence," Snape said silkily.
13046:
  text: |-
    It shattered.
13047:
  text: |-
    She looked at the Head Table for a few seconds longer, at Professor Flitwick and
    Professor Sprout and the empty place where Professor McGonagall should've been.
    Then Hermione Granger turned and began walking toward the Ravenclaw table.
13048:
  text: |-
    There was a babble of voices starting up, as the students came unfrozen from
    where they'd sat.
13049:
  text: |-
    And then, as she was almost to the Ravenclaw table -
13050:
  text: |-
    The dry voice of Professor Quirrell cut through everything, and that voice said,
    "One hundred points to Miss Granger for doing what is right."
13051:
  text: |-
    Hermione almost fell over her own feet; and then she continued forward, even as
    Snape shouted something furious, even as Professor Quirrell leaned back in his
    chair and began to laugh, even as Dumbledore's voice was saying something she
    didn't catch and then she was sitting down at the Ravenclaw table again next to
    Harry Potter.
13052:
  text: |-
    Harry Potter was frozen beside her, he looked like someone who didn't dare move.
13053:
  text: |-
    "It's all right," her voice said to him, automatically without there being any
    choice or thought involved, although really it wasn't right at all. "But can you
    see if you can get me out of Snape's detentions, like you did yourself that
    time?"
13054:
  text: |-
    Harry Potter nodded, a single jerky motion of his head. "I -" said Harry. "I -
    I'm sorry, this - this is all my fault -"
13055:
  text: |-
    "Don't be <em>ridiculous</em>, Harry." It was odd how her voice was coming out
    all normal, and without her thinking about what to say. Hermione looked down at
    her breakfast plate, but eating seemed to be clearly out of the question, there
    was a roiling and churning in her stomach which suggested that she was already
    on the verge of throwing up, which was odd because she could have sworn her
    whole body felt numb, like she wasn't feeling anything, at the same time.
13056:
  text: |-
    "And," her voice said, "if you want to break school rules or something, you can
    ask me about it, I promise I won't just say no."
