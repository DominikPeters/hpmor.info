    The version of decision theory used in this chapter is <em>not</em> the
    academically dominant one. It's based on something called "timeless decision
    theory" that's under development by (among others) Gary Drescher, Wei Dai,
    Vladimir Nesov, and, well... <em>(coughs a few times)</em> me.

    "Albus," Minerva said, not even trying to keep the worry out of her voice as the
    two of them entered the Great Hall, "something has to be done."
6390:
  text: |-
    The atmosphere at Hogwarts before Yuletide was usually bright and cheerful. The
    Great Hall had already been decorated in green and red, after a Slytherin and a
    Gryffindor whose Yule wedding had become a symbol of friendship transcending
    Houses and allegiances, a tradition almost as ancient as Hogwarts itself and
    which had even spread to Muggle countries.

    Now the students eating dinner were glancing nervously over their shoulders, or
    sending vicious glares at other tables, or at some tables arguing heatedly. You
    could have described the atmosphere as <em>tense,</em> perhaps, but the phrase
    coming to Minerva's mind was <em>fifth degree of caution.</em>
6392:
  text: |-
    Take a school, into four Houses divided...
6393:
  text: |-
    Now into each year, add three armies at war.
6394:
  text: |-
    And the partisanship of Dragon and Sunshine and Chaos had spread beyond the
    first-years; they had become the armies for those who had no armies. Students
    were wearing armbands with insignia of fire or smile or upraised hand, and
    hexing each other in the corridors. All three first-year generals had told them
    to stop - even Draco Malfoy had heard her out and then nodded grimly - but their
    supposed followers hadn't listened.
6395:
  text: |-
    Dumbledore gazed out at the tables with a distant look. "<em>In every
    city,</em>" the old wizard quoted softly,"<em>the population has been divided
    for a long time past into the Blue and the Green factions...</em> <em>And they
    fight against their opponents knowing not for what end they imperil
    themselves...</em> <em>So there grows up in them against their fellow men a
    hostility which has no cause, and at no time does it cease or disappear, for it
    gives place neither to the ties of marriage nor of relationship nor of
    friendship, and the case is the same even though those who differ with respect
    to these colours be brothers or any other kin. I, for my part, am unable to call
    this anything except a disease of the soul...</em>"
6396:

    "I'm sorry," said Minerva, "I don't -"
6397:
  text: |-
    "Procopius," said Dumbledore. "They took their chariot-racing very seriously, in
    the Roman Empire. Yes, Minerva, I agree that something must be done."
6398:
  text: |-
    "Soon," Minerva said, her voice lowering even further. "Albus, I think it must
    be done before Saturday."
6399:
  text: |-
    On Sunday, most students would leave Hogwarts to stay the holiday with their
    families; Saturday, then, was the final battle of the three first-year armies
    that would determine the awarding of Professor Quirrell's thrice-cursed
    Christmas wish.
6400:
  text: |-
    Dumbledore glanced over at her, studying her gravely. "You fear that the
    explosion will come then, and someone will be hurt."
6401:
  text: |-
    Minerva nodded.
6402:
  text: |-
    "And that Professor Quirrell will be blamed."
6403:
  text: |-
    Minerva nodded again, her face tight. She had long since become wise in the ways
    that Defense Professors were fired. "Albus," Minerva said, "we cannot lose
    Professor Quirrell now, we <em>cannot!</em> If he but stays through January our
    fifth-years will pass their OWLs, if he stays through March our seventh-years
    will pass their NEWTs, he is remedying years of neglect in months, a whole
    generation will grow up able to defend themselves in spite of the Dark Lord's
    curse - you must stop the battle, Albus! Ban the armies now!"
6404:
  text: |-
    "I am not sure the Defense Professor would take that kindly," said Dumbledore,
    glancing over toward the Head Table where Quirrell was drooling into his soup.
    "He did seem most attached to his armies, though when I agreed I thought there
    would be four in each year." The old wizard sighed. "A clever man, probably with
    the best of intentions; but perhaps not clever enough, I fear. And to ban the
    armies might also trigger the explosion."
6405:
  text: |-
    "But then Albus, what will you <em>do?</em> "
6406:
  text: |-
    The old wizard favored her with a benign smile. "Why, I shall plot, of course.
    It's the new fashion in Hogwarts."
6407:
  text: |-
    And they had come too close to the Head Table for Minerva to say anything more.

    The first battle in December had been... messy, or so Draco had heard.
6410:
  text: |-
    The second battle had been <em>deranged</em>.
6411:
  text: |-
    And the next one would be <em>worse</em>, unless the three of them together
    succeeded in their last desperate attempt to stop it.
6412:
  text: |-
    "Professor Quirrell, this is insanity," Draco said flatly. "This isn't Slytherin
    any more, it's just..<em>.</em>" Draco was at a loss for words. He waved his
    hands helplessly. "You can't possibly do any real plots with all this stuff
    going on. Last battle, one of my soldiers faked his own suicide. We have
    <em>Hufflepuffs</em> trying to plot, and they think they can, but they
    <em>can't.</em> Things just happen at random now, it doesn't have anything to do
    with who's cleverest, or which army fights best, it's..." He couldn't even
    describe it.
6413:
  text: |-
    "I agree with Mr. Malfoy," said Granger in the tones of someone who hadn't ever
    expected to hear herself saying those words. "Allowing traitors isn't working,
    Professor Quirrell."
6414:
  text: |-
    Draco had tried forbidding anyone in his army to plot except him, and that had
    just driven the plots underground, no one wanted to be left out when the
    soldiers in <em>other</em> armies got to plot. After miserably losing their last
    battle, he'd finally given in and revoked his decree; but by then his soldiers
    had already started setting their own personal plans in motion, without any sort
    of central coordination.
6415:
  text: |-
    After being told all the plans, or what his soldiers claimed were their plans,
    Draco had tried to sketch a plot to win the final battle. It had required
    considerably more than three different things to go right, and Draco had used
    <em>Incendio</em> on the paper and <em>Everto</em> to vanish the ashes, because
    if Father had seen it he would have been disowned.
6416:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell's eyelids were half-closed, his chin resting on his hands as
    he leaned forward onto his desk. "And you, Mr. Potter?" said the Defense
    Professor. "Are you likewise in agreement?"
6417:
  text: |-
    "All we'd need to do is shoot Franz Ferdinand and we could start World War One,"
    said Harry. "It's gone to complete chaos. I'm all for it."
6418:
  text: |-
    "<em>Harry!</em> " said Draco in utter shock.
6419:
  text: |-
    He didn't even realize until a second later that he'd said it at exactly the
    same time, and in exactly the same tone of indignation, as Granger.
6420:
  text: |-
    Granger shot him a startled glance, and Draco carefully kept his face neutral.
    Oops.
6421:
  text: |-
    "That's right!" said Harry. "I'm betraying you! Both of you! Again! Ha ha!"
6422:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell was smiling thinly, though his eyes were still half-closed.
    "And why is that, Mr. Potter?"
6423:
  text: |-
    "Because I think I can cope with the chaos better than Miss Granger or Mr.
    Malfoy," said the traitor. "Our war is a zero-sum game, and it doesn't matter
    whether it's easy or hard in an absolute sense, only who does better or worse."
6424:
  text: |-
    Harry Potter was learning far too fast.
6425:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell's eyes moved beneath their lids to regard Draco, and then
    Granger. "In truth, Mr. Malfoy, Miss Granger, I simply could not live with
    myself if I shut down the grand debacle before its climax. One of your soldiers
    has even become a quadruple agent."
6426:
  text: |-
    "<em>Quadruple?</em> " said Granger. "But there's only three sides in the war!"
6427:
  text: |-
    "Yes," said Professor Quirrell, "you'd think that, wouldn't you. I am not sure
    that there has ever in history been a quadruple agent, or any army with such a
    high fraction of real and pretended traitors. We are exploring new realms, Miss
    Granger, and we cannot turn back now."
6428:
  text: |-
    Draco left the Defense Professor's office with his teeth gritting hard against
    each other, and Granger looking even more annoyed beside him.
6429:
  text: |-
    "I can't believe you did that, Harry!" said Granger.
6430:
  text: |-
    "Sorry," Harry said, not sounding sorry at all, his lips curved up in a merry
    smile of evil. "Remember, Hermione, it <em>is</em> just a game, and why should
    generals like us be the only ones who get to plot? And besides, what are the two
    of you going to do about it? Team up against me?"
6431:
  text: |-
    Draco traded glances with Granger, knowing that his own face was as tight as
    hers. Harry had been relying, more and more openly and gloatingly, on Draco's
    refusal to make common cause with a mudblood girl; and Draco was beginning to
    get <em>sick</em> of having that used against him. If this kept up much longer
    he <em>was</em> going to ally with Granger just to crush Harry Potter, and see
    how much the son of a mudblood liked <em>that.</em>

    The terrifying part was how fast the whole thing had spiraled out of control.
6433:
  text: |-
    Hermione stared at the parchment Zabini had given her, feeling utterly and
    completely helpless.
6434:
  text: |-
    There were names, and lines connecting the names to other names, and some of the
    lines were in different colors and...
6435:
  text: |-
    "Tell me," said General Granger, "is there anyone in my army who <em>isn't</em>
    a spy?"
6436:
  text: |-
    The two of them weren't in the office but in another, deserted classroom, and
    they were alone; because, Colonel Zabini had said, it was now nearly certain
    that at least one of the captains was a traitor. Probably Captain Goldstein, but
    Zabini didn't know for sure.
6437:
  text: |-
    Her question had put an ironic smile on the young Slytherin's face. Blaise
    Zabini always seemed a little disdainful of her, but he didn't seem to actively
    dislike her; nothing like the derision he held for Draco Malfoy, or the
    resentment he had developed for Harry Potter. She had worried at first about
    Zabini betraying her, but the boy seemed desperate to show that the other two
    generals were no better than him; and Hermione thought that while Zabini would
    probably be happy to sell her out to anyone <em>else</em>, he'd never let Malfoy
    or Harry win.
6438:
  text: |-
    "Most of your soldiers <em>are</em> still loyal to you, I'm pretty sure," said
    Zabini. "It's just that no one wants to be left out of the fun." The scornful
    look on the Slytherin's face made it clear what he thought of people who didn't
    take plotting seriously. "So they think they can be double agents and secretly
    work for our side while pretending to betray us."
6439:
  text: |-
    "And that would also go for anyone in the <em>other</em> armies who says they
    want to be <em>our</em> spy," Hermione said carefully.
6440:
  text: |-
    The young Slytherin shrugged. "I think I did a good job of telling which ones
    really want to sell out Malfoy, I'm not sure <em>anyone</em> really wants to
    sell out Potter to you. But Nott is a sure bet for betraying Potter to Malfoy
    and since I had Entwhistle approach him supposedly on behalf of Malfoy and
    Entwhistle really reports to us, that's almost as good -"
6441:
  text: |-
    Hermione closed her eyes for a moment. "We're going to lose, aren't we?"
6442:
  text: |-
    "Look," Zabini said patiently, "You're in the lead right now on Quirrell points.
    We just have to not lose this last battle <em>completely</em> and you'll have
    enough Quirrell points to win the Christmas wish."
6443:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell had announced that the final battle would operate on a formal
    scoring system, which he'd been asked to do to avoid recriminations afterward.
    Each time you shot someone, the general of your army got two Quirrell points. A
    gong would ring through the battle area (they didn't know yet where they would
    be fighting, though Hermione was hoping for the forest again, where Sunshine did
    well) and its pitch would tell which army had won the points. And if anyone was
    faking being hit, the gong would ring out anyway, and then a double gong would
    ring later, after no fixed time, to hail the retraction. And if you called the
    name of an army, cried "For Sunshine!" or "For Chaos!" or "For Dragon!", it
    switched your allegiance to that army...
6444:
  text: |-
    Even Hermione had been able to see the flaw in <em>that</em> set of rules. But
    Professor Quirrell had gone on to announce that if you'd been originally
    assigned to Sunshine, nobody could shoot you in the name of Sunshine - or
    rather, they could, but then Sunshine lost a single Quirrell point, symbolized
    by a triple gong. That prevented you from shooting your own soldiers for points,
    and discouraged suiciding before the enemy got you, but you could still shoot
    spies if you had to.
6445:
  text: |-
    Right now, Hermione had two hundred and forty-four Quirrell points, and Malfoy
    had two hundred and nineteen, and Harry had two hundred and twenty-one; and
    there were twenty-four soldiers in each army.
6446:
  text: |-
    "So we fight carefully," Hermione said, "and just try not to lose too badly."
6447:
  text: |-
    "No," said Zabini. The young Slytherin's face was now serious. "The problem is,
    Malfoy and Potter both know that their only way to win is to combine and crush
    us, then fight it out on their own. So here's what I think we should do -"
6448:
  text: |-
    Hermione left the classroom in something of a daze. Zabini's plan hadn't been
    the obvious one, it had been strange and complicated and layered and the sort of
    thing she would've expected Harry to come up with, not Zabini. It felt wrong
    just for her to be able to <em>understand</em> a plan like that. Young girls
    shouldn't be able to understand plans like that. The Hat would've Sorted her
    into Slytherin, if it'd seen that she could understand plans like that...

    The awesome thing was how fast he'd been able to escalate the chaos once he
    started doing it deliberately.
6450:
  text: |-
    Harry sat in his office; he'd been given the authority to order furniture from
    the house elves, so he'd ordered a throne, and curtains in a black and crimson
    pattern. Scarlet light like blood, mixed with shadow, poured over the floor.
6451:
  text: |-
    Something in Harry felt like he'd finally come home.
6452:
  text: |-
    Before him stood the four Lieutenants of Chaos, his most trusted minions, one of
    whom was a traitor.
6453:
  text: |-
    This. This was what life should be like.
6454:
  text: |-
    "We are gathered," said Harry.
6455:
  text: |-
    "Let Chaos reign," chorused his four Lieutenants.
6456:
  text: |-
    "My hovercraft is full of eels," said Harry.
6457:
  text: |-
    "I will not buy this record, it is scratched," chorused his four Lieutenants.
6458:
  text: |-
    "All mimsy were the borogroves."
6459:
  text: |-
    "And the mome raths outgrabe!"
6460:
  text: |-
    That concluded the formalities.
6461:
  text: |-
    "How goes the confusion?" Harry said in a dry whisper like Emperor Palpatine.
6462:
  text: |-
    "It goes well, General Chaos," said Neville in the tone he always used for
    military matters, a tone so deep that the boy often had to stop and cough. The
    Chaotic Lieutenant was neatly dressed in his black school robes, trimmed in the
    yellow of Hufflepuff House, and his hair was parted and combed in the usual look
    for an earnest young boy. Harry had liked the incongruity better than any of the
    cloaks they'd tried. "Our Legionnaires have begun five new plots since yesterday
    evening."
6463:
  text: |-
    Harry smiled evilly. "Do any of them have a chance of working?"
6464:
  text: |-
    "I don't think so," said Neville of Chaos. "Here's the report."
6465:
  text: |-
    "Excellent," said Harry, and laughed chillingly as he took the parchment from
    Neville's hand, trying his best to make it sound like he was choking on dust.
    That brought the total to sixty.
6466:
  text: |-
    Let Draco <em>try</em> to handle that. Let him <em>try</em>.
6467:
  text: |-
    And as for Blaise Zabini...
6468:
  text: |-
    Harry laughed again, and this time it didn't even take an effort to sound evil.
    He really needed to borrow someone's pet Kneazle for his staff meetings, so he'd
    have a cat to stroke while he did this.
6469:
  text: |-
    "Can the Legion stop making plots now?" said Finnigan of Chaos. "I mean, don't
    we have enough already -"
6470:
  text: |-
    "No," Harry said flatly. "We can <em>never</em> have enough plots."
6471:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell had put it perfectly. They were pushing the boundaries
    further, perhaps, than they had ever been pushed; and Harry wouldn't have been
    able to live with himself if he'd turned back now.
6472:
  text: |-
    There came a knock at the door.
6473:
  text: |-
    "That will be the Dragon General," Harry said, smiling with evil prescience. "He
    arrives precisely as I expected. Do show him in, and yourselves out."
6474:
  text: |-
    And the four Lieutenants of Chaos shuffled out, casting dark looks at Draco as
    the enemy general entered into Harry's secret lair.
6475:
  text: |-
    If he wasn't allowed to do this when he was older, Harry was just going to stay
    eleven forever.

6476:
  text: |-
    The sun was dripping through the red curtains, sending rays of blood dancing
    across the floor from behind Harry Potter's grownup-sized cushioned chair, which
    he had covered in gold and silver glitter and insisted on referring to as his
    throne.
6477:
  text: |-
    (Draco was beginning to feel a lot more confident that he'd done the right thing
    in deciding to overthrow Harry Potter before he could take over the world. Draco
    couldn't even <em>imagine</em> what it would be like to live under his rule.)
6478:
  text: |-
    "Good evening, Dragon General," said Harry Potter in a chill whisper. "You have
    arrived just as I expected."
6479:
  text: |-
    This was not surprising, considering that Draco and Harry had agreed on the
    meeting time in advance.
6480:
  text: |-
    And it also wasn't evening, but by now Draco knew better than to say anything.
6481:
  text: |-
    "General Potter," Draco said with as much dignity as he could manage, "you know
    that our two armies have to work together for <em>either</em> of us to win
    Professor Quirrell's wish, right?"
6482:
  text: |-
    "Yesss," hissed Harry, like the boy thought he was a Parselmouth. "We must
    cooperate to destroy Sunshine, and only then fight it out between us. But if one
    of us betrays the other earlier on, that one could gain an advantage in the
    later fight. And the Sunshine General, who knows all this, will try to trick
    each of us into thinking the other has betrayed them. And you and I, who know
    that, will be tempted to betray the other and pretend that it is Granger's
    trickery. And Granger knows <em>that</em>, as well."
6483:
  text: |-
    Draco nodded. That much was obvious. "And... both of us <em>only</em> want to
    win, and there's no one else who'll punish either of us if we defect..."
6484:
  text: |-
    "Precisely," said Harry Potter, his face now turning serious. "We are faced with
    a <em>true</em> Prisoner's Dilemma."
6485:
  text: |-
    The Prisoner's Dilemma, according to Harry's teachings, ran thus: Two prisoners
    had been locked in separate cells. There was evidence against each prisoner, but
    only minor evidence, enough for a prison sentence of two years apiece. Each
    prisoner could opt to <em>defect,</em> betray the other, testify against them in
    court; and this would take one year off their own prison sentence, but add two
    years to the other's. Or a prisoner could <em>cooperate,</em> staying silent. So
    if both prisoners defected, each testifying against the other, they would serve
    three years apiece; if both cooperated, or stayed silent, they would serve two
    years each; but if one defected and the other cooperated, the defector would
    serve a single year, and the cooperator would serve four.
6486:
  text: |-
    And both prisoners had to make their decision without knowing the other one's
    choice, and neither would be given a chance to change their decision afterward.
6487:
  text: |-
    Draco had observed that if the two prisoners had been Death Eaters during the
    Wizarding War, the Dark Lord would have killed any traitors.
6488:
  text: |-
    Harry had nodded and said that was <em>one</em> way to resolve the Prisoner's
    Dilemma - and in fact both Death Eaters would <em>want</em> there to be a Dark
    Lord for exactly that reason.
6489:
  text: |-
    (Draco had asked Harry to stop and let him to think about this for a while
    before they continued. It had explained a <em>lot</em> about why Father and his
    friends had agreed to serve under a Dark Lord who often wasn't nice to them...)
6490:
  text: |-
    In fact, Harry had said, this was pretty much the reason why people had
    governments - <em>you</em> might be better off if you stole from someone else,
    just like each prisoner would be individually better off if they defected in the
    Prisoner's Dilemma. But if <em>everyone</em> thought like that, the country
    would fall into chaos and everyone would be worse off, like what would happen if
    both prisoners defected. So people let themselves be ruled by governments, just
    like the Death Eaters had let themselves be ruled by the Dark Lord.
6491:
  text: |-
    (Draco had asked Harry to stop again. Draco had always taken for granted that
    ambitious wizards put themselves in power because they wanted to rule, and
    people let themselves be ruled because they were scared little Hufflepuffs. And
    this, on reflection, still seemed true; but Harry's perspective was fascinating
    even if it was wrong.)
6492:
  text: |-
    But, Harry had continued afterward, the fear of a third party punishing you was
    not the <em>only</em> possible reason to cooperate in the Prisoner's Dilemma.
6493:
  text: |-
    Suppose, Harry had said, you were playing the game against a magically produced
    identical copy of yourself.
6494:
  text: |-
    Draco had said that if there were two Dracos, of course neither Draco would want
    anything bad to happen to the other one, not to mention that no Malfoy would let
    himself become known as a traitor.
6495:
  text: |-
    Harry had nodded again, and said that this was yet <em>another</em> solution to
    the Prisoner's Dilemma - people might cooperate because they cared about each
    other, or because they had senses of honor, or because they wanted to preserve
    their reputation. Indeed, Harry had said, it was rather difficult to construct a
    <em>true</em> Prisoner's Dilemma - in real life, people usually cared about the
    other person, or their honor or their reputation or a Dark Lord's punishment or
    <em>something</em> besides the prison sentences. But suppose the copy had been
    of someone <em>completely</em> selfish -
6496:
  text: |-
    (Pansy Parkinson had been the example they'd used)
6497:
  text: |-
    - so each Pansy only cared what happened to <em>her</em> and not to the other
    Pansy.
6498:
  text: |-
    <em>Given</em> that this was all Pansy cared about... and that there was no Dark
    Lord... and Pansy wasn't worried about her reputation... and Pansy either had no
    sense of honor or didn't consider herself obligated to the other prisoner...
    <em>then</em> would the rational thing be for Pansy to cooperate, or defect?
6499:
  text: |-
    Some people, Harry said, claimed that the rational thing to do was for Pansy to
    defect against her copy, but Harry, plus someone named Douglas Hofstadter,
    thought these people were wrong. Because, Harry had said, if Pansy defected -
    not at random, but for what seemed to her like <em>rational reasons</em> - then
    the other Pansy would think exactly the same way. Two identical copies wouldn't
    decide different things. So Pansy had to choose between a world in which both
    Pansies cooperated, or a world in which both Pansies defected, and she was
    better off if both copies cooperated. And if Harry had thought 'rational' people
    <em>did</em> defect in the Prisoner's Dilemma, then he wouldn't have done
    anything to spread that kind of 'rationality', because a country or a conspiracy
    full of 'rational' people would dissolve into chaos. You would tell your
    <em>enemies</em> about 'rationality'.

    Which had all <em>sounded</em> reasonable at the time, but <em>now</em> the
    thought was occurring to Draco that...
6501:
  text: |-
    "<em>You</em> said," Draco said, "that the rational solution to the Prisoner's
    Dilemma is to cooperate. But of course <em>you</em> would want me to believe
    that, wouldn't you?" And if Draco was fooled into cooperating, Harry would just
    say, <em>Ha ha, betrayed you again!</em> and laugh at him about it afterward.
6502:
  text: |-
    "I wouldn't fake your lessons," Harry said seriously. "But I have to remind you,
    Draco, that I didn't say you should just automatically cooperate. Not on a
    <em>true</em> Prisoner's Dilemma like this one. What I said was that when you
    choose, you shouldn't think like you're choosing for just yourself, <em>or</em>
    like you're choosing for everyone. You should think like you're choosing for all
    the people who are <em>similar enough</em> to you that they'll probably do the
    same thing you do for the same reasons. And also choosing the predictions made
    by anyone who knows you well enough to predict you accurately, so that you never
    have to regret being rational because of the correct predictions that other
    people make about you - remind me to explain about Newcomb's Problem at some
    point. So the question you and I have to ask, Draco, is this: are we similar
    enough that we'll probably do the <em>same thing</em> whatever it is, making our
    decisions in mostly the same way? Or do we know each other well enough to
    predict each other, so that <em>I</em> can predict whether you'll cooperate or
    defect, and <em>you</em> can predict that I've decided to do the same thing I
    predict you'll do, because <em>I</em> know that you can predict me deciding
    that?"
6503:
  text: |-
    ...and Draco could not help but think that since he had to strain just to
    understand <em>half</em> of that, the answer was obviously 'No'.
6504:
  text: |-
    "Yes," said Draco.
6505:
  text: |-
    There was a pause.
6506:
  text: |-
    "I see," said Harry, sounding disappointed. "Oh, well. I guess we'll have to
    think of some other way, then."
6507:
  text: |-
    Draco hadn't thought that was going to work.
6508:
  text: |-
    Draco and Harry talked about it back and forth. They had both agreed much
    earlier that what they did on the battlefield would <em>not</em> count as broken
    promises in real life - though Draco was a little angry about what Harry had
    done in Professor Quirrell's office, and said so.
6509:
  text: |-
    But if the two of them couldn't rely on honor or friendship, that <em>did</em>
    leave the question of how to get their armies to work together on beating
    Sunshine, despite everything Granger might try to break them up. Professor
    Quirrell's rules didn't make it tempting to let Sunshine kill the other army's
    soldiers - that just increased the bar you had to pass yourself - but it did
    tempt each side to steal kills instead of acting like a single army would, or to
    shoot some of the other side's soldiers during the confusion of battle...

    Draco had hoped that they would be fighting in the upper levels of Hogwarts
    again. Professor Quirrell had said that real fights were more likely to take
    place in cities than forests, and fighting inside schoolrooms and corridors was
    supposed to simulate that, with ribbons to mark the allowed areas. Dragon Army
    had done well in those fights.
6517:
  text: |-
    Instead, just as Draco had feared, Professor Quirrell had come up with something
    <em>special</em> for this battle.
6518:
  text: |-
    The battleground was the Hogwarts Lake.
6519:
  text: |-
    And not in boats, either.
6520:
  text: |-
    They were fighting <em>underwater</em>.
6521:
  text: |-
    The Giant Squid had been temporarily paralyzed; spells had been set in place to
    keep away the grindylows; Professor Quirrell had gone and talked to the merfolk;
    and all the soldiers had been issued <em>potions of underwater action</em> that
    allowed them to breathe, see clearly, talk to each other, and swim not quite as
    fast as a fast walk by kicking their legs.
6522:
  text: |-
    A huge silver sphere hung in the center of the battleground, shining like a
    small underwater moon. It would help to provide a sense of direction - at first.
    The moon would slowly go into eclipse as the battle went on, and when it had
    gone entirely dark, the battle would end if it hadn't already.
6523:
  text: |-
    War in water. You couldn't defend a perimeter, attackers could come at you from
    any direction, and even with the potion you couldn't see very far in the
    darkness of the lake.
6524:
  text: |-
    And if you swam too far away from the action, you would start to glow after a
    while, and be easy to hunt down - ordinarily if an army scattered and ran
    instead of fighting, Professor Quirrell would just declare them defeated; but
    today they were working on a points system. Of course you still had some time
    <em>before</em> you started to glow, if you wanted to play assassin.
6525:
  text: |-
    Dragon Army had been set low in the water at the start of the game; above and
    far away, the distant underwater moon shone. The murky water was mostly lit by
    <em>Lumos</em> Charms, though his soldiers would extinguish the lights as soon
    as they began maneuvers. There was no point in letting the enemy see you before
    you saw them.
6526:
  text: |-
    Draco kicked his legs a few times, propelling him to a higher position from
    which he could gaze down at where his soldiers hovered in the water.
6527:
  text: |-
    The conversations died down almost at once under Draco's icy glare, his soldiers
    looking up at him with gratifying expressions of fear and worry.
6528:
  text: |-
    "Listen to me very carefully," said General Malfoy. His voice came out a little
    lower, a little burbly with bubbles, <em>libsten to me vebwy caerbfully</em>,
    but the sound traveled clearly. "There's only one way we can win this. We've got
    to march on Sunshine together with Chaos, and beat Sunshine. <em>Then</em> we
    fight it out with Potter and win. That's <em>got</em> to happen, understand? No
    matter what else goes on, that part <em>has</em> to happen that way -"
6529:
  text: |-
    And Draco explained the plan he and Harry had come up with.
6530:
  text: |-
    Astonished looks were exchanged among the soldiers.
6531:
  text: |-
    "- and if any of <em>your</em> plots get in the way of that," finished Draco,
    "after we are out of the water, I will set you on <em>fire</em>."
6532:
  text: |-
    There was a nervous chorus of yessirs.
6533:
  text: |-
    "And everyone with secret orders, make sure you carry them out <em>to the
    letter,</em>" said Draco.
6534:
  text: |-
    Around half his soldiers <em>openly nodded,</em> and Draco marked them for death
    after he rose to power.
6535:
  text: |-
    Of course all the private orders were fake, like one Dragon being told to offer
    a false traitor's commission to another Dragon, and the second Dragon being told
    in hushed confidence to report anything said by the first Dragon. Draco had told
    each Dragon that the whole war could depend on that one thing, and that he hoped
    they understood it was more important than the plans they'd previously made.
    With luck that would keep all the idiots happy, and maybe flush out a few spies
    to boot, if the reports didn't match the instructions.
6536:
  text: |-
    Draco's real plan for winning against Chaos... well, it was simpler than the one
    he'd burned, but Father still wouldn't have liked it. Despite trying, though,
    Draco hadn't been able to think of anything better. It was a plot that couldn't
    <em>possibly</em> have worked against anyone except Harry Potter. In fact it had
    <em>been</em> Harry's plan originally, according to the traitor, though Draco
    had guessed that without being told. Draco and the traitor had just modified it
    a little...

    A hollow, booming bell echoed through the water, and on the instant, Zabini and
    Anthony and five other soldiers struck out downward, into the murky depths of
    the lake. Parvati Patil, the only Gryffindor in the group, turned her head back
    for a moment and gave them all a cheery wave as she dived; and after a moment,
    Scott and Matt did the same. The rest just sank and vanished.
6545:

    General Granger swallowed a lump in her throat as she watched them go. She was
    risking everything on this, dividing her army instead of just trying to take as
    many enemy soldiers with them as possible.
6546:
  text: |-
    The thing to realize, Zabini had told her, was that no army would move until
    they had a plan that let them expect victory. Sunshine couldn't just plan to win
    themselves, they had to make both other armies <em>think</em> they would win
    until it was too late.
6547:

    Ernie and Ron still looked like they were in shock. Susan was gazing after the
    disappearing soldiers with a calculating look. Her army, what was left of it,
    just looked bewildered, traceries of light dappling on their uniforms as they
    all drifted just below the sunlit surface of the lake.
6548:
  text: |-
    "<em>Now</em> what?" said Ron.
6549:
  text: |-
    "Now we wait," said Hermione, loudly enough for all the soldiers to hear. It
    felt odd to talk with her mouth full of water, she kept feeling like she was
    committing some sort of horrible impoliteness at the dinner table and was about
    to drool all over herself. "All of us left here are going to get zapped, but
    that was going to happen anyway with Dragon and Chaos ganging up on us. We've
    just got to take as many of them with us as we can."
6550:

    "I've got a plan," said one of her Sunshine Soldiers... Hannah, her voice had
    been a little hard to recognize at first. "It's like all complicated, but I know
    how we can get Dragon and Chaos to start fighting each other -"
6551:

    "Me too!" said Fay. "I've got a plan too! See, Neville Longbottom is secretly on
    our side -"
6552:

    "<em>You</em> were talking to Neville?" said Ernie. "That's not right,
    <em>I</em> was the one who -"
6553:
  text: |-
    Daphne Greengrass and a couple of other Slytherins who hadn't gone with Zabini
    were giggling helplessly as the cries of "No, wait, <em>I</em> was the one who
    got Longbottom" erupted from one soldier after another.
6554:
  text: |-
    Hermione just looked at them all wearily.
6555:
  text: |-
    "Okay," said Hermione when it had all died down, "does everyone get it? All your
    plots were faked by the Chaos Legion, or maybe some by Dragon. Anyone who
    <em>really</em> wanted to betray Harry or Malfoy went straight to me or Zabini,
    not you. Just go ahead and compare notes on all your secret plots and you'll see
    it for yourselves." She might not be as good at plotting as Zabini, but she
    could always understand what all her officers told her, that was why Professor
    Quirrell had made her the general. "So don't bother trying to do any plots when
    the other armies get here. Just fight, okay? Please?"
6556:
  text: |-
    "But," said Ernie with shock on his face, "Neville is in <em>Hufflepuff!</em>
    You're saying he <em>lied</em> to us?"
6557:

    Daphne was laughing so hard and so helplessly that the exhalations had turned
    her upside down in the water.
6558:
  text: |-
    "I'm not sure <em>what</em> Longbottom is," said Ron darkly, "but I don't think
    he's a Hufflepuff any more. Not now that <em>Harry Potter's</em> got to him."
6559:
  text: |-
    "Do you know," said Susan, "I <em>asked</em> him that, and Neville told me he
    had become a Chaos Hufflepuff?"
6560:
  text: |-
    "<em>Anyway</em>," said Hermione in a loud voice. "Zabini took with everyone who
    we thought was a spy, so in <em>our</em> army we can stop watching each other
    quite so hard now, I hope."
6561:
  text: |-
    "<em>Anthony</em> was a spy?" yelled Ron.
6562:
  text: |-
    "<em>Parvati</em> was a spy?" gasped Hannah.
6563:

    "Parvati was <em>totally</em> a spy," said Daphne. "She shopped at the spy shoe
    store and wore spy lipstick, and someday she's going to marry a nice spy husband
    and have a lot of little spies."
6564:

    And then a gong sound echoed through the water, indicating that Sunshine had

    Neville Longbottom kicked his feet in slow, measured motions. Diving, always
    diving in whatever direction you happened to be moving. You wanted to show the
    enemy the smallest profile, present them with your head or your feet. So you
    were always diving, downward and head-first, and the enemy was always
    <em>down.</em>
6570:

    Like every Chaos Legionnaire in the army, Neville's head was constantly rotating
    as he swam, looking up, down, around, to every side. Not just watching for
    Sunshine Soldiers, but watching for any sign that a Chaos Legionnaire had drawn
    their wand and was about to betray them. Usually traitors waited until the
    confusion of battle to make their move, but that early gong had put them all on
    guard.
6571:
  text: |-
    ...the truth was, Neville was feeling sad about that. In November he'd been a
    soldier in a united army, all of them pulling together and helping each other,
    and now they were all watching each other constantly for the first signs of
    betrayal. It might have been more fun for General Chaos, but it wasn't nearly as
    much fun for Neville.
6572:

    The direction formerly known as 'up' was getting steadily brighter, as they came
    closer to the surface and Sunshine.

    Neville's squad drew their wands, pointing them straight ahead toward the enemy,

    Then it all snapped into place.
6584:

    Every time a soldier originally from Sunshine got shot by someone crying the
    name of Sunshine, she would lose a Quirrell point. When two Sunshine Soldiers
    were shot by either army, <em>both</em> enemy armies would be two points closer
    to overtaking her, it was the same gain only <em>shared</em>. And if anyone shot
    another soldier <em>not</em> in the name of Sunshine, that gong
    <em>wouldn't</em> get lost in the confusion...

    Hermione was suddenly very glad that Zabini hadn't gone with the obvious plan of
    starting trouble between the other two armies while they attacked Sunshine.

    It was still disheartening, though, that sense of your chances closing down, of
    hope being taken away.
6587:

    Most of Hermione's soldiers were still looking confused, but some had
    expressions of dawning horror as they got it.
6588:

    "It's all right," Susan Bones said firmly. Heads turned to look at the Sunshine
    Captain. "Our job is the same, to take as many of them with us as we can. And
    remember, Zabini took away all the spies! We don't have to stay on the lookout
    like <em>they</em> do!" The girl was smiling defiantly, provoking answering
    smiles from many of the other soldiers, even from Hermione herself. "It can be
    like it was in November. We just have to keep our heads high, fight our best,
    and trust each other -"

    Captain Weasley spun and raised his wand toward Neville and fired. But Neville
    was swimming <em>downward</em> toward him, wand pointed straight ahead, and that
    meant the Simple Shield could shelter Neville's entire profile; if anyone shot

6592:

    A grimly determined look came over Captain Weasley's face, and he arrowed
    straight up toward Neville, mouthing the word <em>Contego,</em> though the
    shield wasn't visible in the water.

    The two enemy champions shot toward each other like arrows released from bows,

    Closer and yet closer, the two champions charged, neither willing to swerve, the
    first person to turn would present a vulnerable broadside and get shot, though

    <em>Would you SHUT UP about that worthless lump of rubble, it wasn't even alive
    let alone sentient, that is like the most pathetic childhood trauma ever -</em>
6616:
  text: |-
    The two armies swiftly separated, becoming two shoals of fish once more.
6617:
  text: |-
    General Granger had gone down seventeen points, and taken three Chaotics and two
    Dragons with her; and one Chaotic and two Dragons had been shot as traitors. So
    she'd lost net seven points, Harry had lost one, Draco had lost two; that put
    Sunshine twenty points up on Dragon, and seventeen points up on Chaos. Chaos
    could still win easily if they exterminated all twenty remaining Dragons. The
    wild card, of course, being those seven remaining Sunshine Soldiers...
6618:
  text: |-
    ...if you could call them that.
6619:
  text: |-
    The two shoals swam uneasily next to each other, the soldiers in each army
    awaiting an order to call out their true allegiances, and attack...
6620:
  text: |-
    "Everyone who got them," Harry said loudly, "remember Special Orders One through
    Three. And don't forget it's Merlin Says on Three. Do not acknowledge."
6621:
  text: |-
    The trustworthy two-thirds of the army did not nod, and the other third just
    looked puzzled.
6622:
  text: |-
    <em>Special Order One: Don't bother trying to call out any codewords in this
    battle, don't expend effort on any plot not specially approved by the commander;
    just swim, shield, and fire.</em>
6623:
  text: |-
    Hermione and Draco had both been fighting their soldiers, trying to get them to
    stop plotting on their own all through December. Harry had egged his soldiers on
    and supported their plotting through the last two battles... while also telling
    them that at some <em>future</em> point he might ask them to put a plot or two
    on hold, to which they'd all readily agreed. So now, in this critical battle,
    they were happy to obey.
6624:
  text: |-
    Neither Hermione or Draco could have given that order successfully, Harry was
    certain. It was the difference between your soldiers seeing you as an ally in
    their plotting, and seeing you as a spoilsport old fuddy-duddy who didn't want
    them to have any fun. Imposition of order equaled escalation of chaos, and it
    also worked in reverse...
6625:
  text: |-
    "There they are!" shouted someone, and pointed.
6626:
  text: |-
    From the depths of the lake arose the forgotten ones, the ones who'd forsaken
    the last battle, the seven missing Sunshine Soldiers, glowing with the bright
    aura of cowards, now fading as they returned to battle.
6627:
  text: |-
    The two shoals of fish wavered, pointing wands uneasily.
6628:
  text: |-
    "Hold your fire!" shouted Harry, and a similar cry came from General Malfoy.
6629:
  text: |-
    There was a moment of held breath.
6630:
  text: |-
    Then the seven Sunshine Soldiers swam up to join Dragon Army.
6631:
  text: |-
    There was a triumphant cheer from Dragon Army.
6632:
  text: |-
    There were cries of dismay from a third of the Chaos Legion.
6633:
  text: |-
    Some of the other two-thirds smiled, though they shouldn't have.
6634:
  text: |-
    Harry wasn't smiling.
6635:
  text: |-
    <em>Oh, this is so completely not going to work...</em>
6636:
  text: |-
    But Harry hadn't been able to think of anything better.
6637:
  text: |-
    "Special Orders Two and Three still apply!" shouted Harry. "Fight!"
6638:
  text: |-
    "<em>For the Chaos Legion!</em> " roared twenty Chaotic Legionnaires.
6639:
  text: |-
    "<em>For Dragon Army!</em> " roared twenty Dragon Warriors and seven Sunshine
    Soldiers.
6640:
  text: |-
    And the Chaotics dived straight downward, as all the traitors got ready to
    strike.

    <em>Granger: 237 / Malfoy: 220 / Potter: 226</em>
6642:
  text: |-
    Draco's head darted around frantically, trying to weigh up what was happening;
    somehow, despite his greater forces, he'd <em>lost the initiative.</em> Four
    small Chaotic forces were being pursued by four larger Dragon forces, but
    because Draco's forces were the ones trying to force an engagement, it meant
    that they had to <em>follow</em> where Chaos <em>ran,</em> and somehow that was
    producing concentrations of Chaotic force that would fire into the exposed sides
    of Dragon -
6643:
  text: |-
    It was happening <em>again!</em>
6644:
  text: |-
    "<em>Prismatis!</em> " shouted Draco, raising his wand, and that shield you
    could see even through the water, a sparkling multicolored flat wall wide enough
    to shield Draco and the five other Dragons with him from the Chaotic force that
    had just started firing on them as they swam past, and <em>that</em> let the
    other five Dragons turn <em>their</em> attentions back to the Chaotic force
    they'd been chasing -
6645:
  text: |-
    There was a tense moment as sleep spell after sleep spell crashed into Draco's
    Prismatic Wall, and Draco was hoping to Merlin that none of those four Chaotics
    had learned the Breaking Drill Hex -
6646:
  text: |-
    Then there was the bell of a Dragon victory, and the Chaotic force spun head-
    for-foot and began swimming away; and Draco, his hands now shaking slightly,
    dropped the Prismatic Wall and lowered his wand.
6647:
  text: |-
    Fighting in water was more exhausting even than fighting on broomsticks.
6648:
  text: |-
    "<em>Do not pursue!</em> " Draco cried to his soldiers as they started to
    follow, then, "<em>Sonorus! REFORM ON ME!</em> "
6649:
  text: |-
    The Dragon forces started converging on Draco, and the Chaotic forces spun
    around and began <em>pursuing</em> the Dragons on the instant - Draco swore out
    loud as he heard the bell of a Chaotic victory, someone hadn't gotten their
    Simple Shield oriented right - and then the Dragon forces were in supporting
    range of each other and the Chaotics were moving back into the murky distance.
6650:
  text: |-
    Somehow, despite their numerical superiority, the Dragons had scored three times
    against the Chaotics and the Chaotics had scored four times back, and he'd heard
    one Dragon spy get executed. Either Harry Potter had thought of a lot of very
    good ideas very fast, or for some unimaginable reason he'd already spent a lot
    of time working out how to fight underwater. This wasn't working, and Draco
    needed to rethink things.
6651:
  text: |-
    It looked like everyone was having trouble aiming while swimming, too, the
    battle might last long enough that time would be called... the distant
    underwater moon was only half full now, that wasn't good... he had to rethink
    things <em>fast...</em>
6652:
  text: |-
    "What is it?" said Padma Patil, as she and her force swam over toward Draco.
6653:
  text: |-
    Padma was his second-in-command; she was clever and powerful, and better yet,
    she hated Granger and saw Harry as a rival, which made her <em>trustworthy.</em>
    Working with Padma was making him realize the truth of the old adage that
    Ravenclaw was sister to Slytherin; Draco had been surprised when his father had
    told him it was an acceptable House for his future wife, but now he saw the
    sense of it.
6654:
  text: |-
    "Wait until we're all here," Draco said. The truth was, he needed to catch his
    breath. That was the trouble with being the general <em>and</em> the most
    powerful wizard, you had to keep using magic.
6655:
  text: |-
    Zabini came in next, commanding a force of two Sunnies and four Dragons, one of
    whom was Gregory keeping an eye on Zabini. Draco didn't trust Zabini. And
    neither Draco nor Zabini trusted the Sunnies enough to make them a majority of
    any unit; they were <em>supposed</em> to be loyal either to Draco directly, or
    to Granger who'd been fooled by the promise that the Dragons would be betrayed
    in the end after both forces had been depleted, just as Harry's more trusted
    Chaotics should've been fooled into not shooting at the Sunnies by the promise
    of their firing fake Sleep Hexes and switching to support Chaos later; but it
    was possible some of the Sunnies <em>were</em> loyal to Chaos and
    <em>weren't</em> firing real Sleep Hexes and that was why Dragon wasn't winning
    the way their numerical advantage should've let them win...
6656:
  text: |-
    The next unit that approached was depleted, three soldiers holding wands on two
    other soldiers, who were swimming with empty hands.
6657:
  text: |-
    Draco gritted his teeth. More traitor problems. He needed to talk to Professor
    Quirrell about having some way to <em>punish</em> traitors at least, conditions
    like these were <em>unrealistic</em>, in real life you tortured your traitors to
    death.
6658:
  text: |-
    "General Malfoy!" shouted the commander of the problem unit as it swam up, a
    Ravenclaw boy named Terry. "We don't know what to do - Cesi shot Bogdan, but
    Cesi says Kellah told him that Bogdan shot Specter -"
6659:
  text: |-
    "I <em>didn't!</em> " said Kellah.
6660:
  text: |-
    "Yes you <em>did!</em> " shrieked Cesi. "General Malfoy, <em>she's</em> the spy,
    I should've rea-"
6661:
  text: |-
    "<em>Somnium,</em>" said Draco.
6662:
  text: |-
    There was the triple bell of a one-point loss from Dragon, and then Kellah's
    limp body began to float away in the water.
6663:
  text: |-
    Draco <em>had</em> heard the word 'recursion' by this point, and he knew a Harry
    Potter plot when he saw one.
6664:
  text: |-
    (Unfortunately Draco had <em>not</em> heard of autoimmune disorders, and the
    thought did <em>not</em> readily occur to him that a clever virus would begin
    its attack by creating symptoms of an autoimmune disorder so as to get the body
    to distrust its own immune system...)
6665:
  text: |-
    "<em>General order!</em> " said Draco, raising his voice. "Nobody gets to shoot
    spies except myself, Gregory, Padma, and Terry. If anyone sees anything
    suspicious they come to one of <em>us.</em>"
6666:
  text: |-
    And then -
6667:
  text: |-
    There was the bell of Sunshine scoring two points.
6668:
  text: |-
    "<em>What?</em> " said Draco and Zabini around the same time; their heads
    swiveled around. No one seemed to have gotten hit, and all the Sunshine soldiers
    were present and accounted for. (Except Parvati, who had been shot by some
    still-unknown traitor in Padma's squad; and of course Padma had shot Parvati
    again in case she was faking, so it wasn't her...)
6669:
  text: |-
    "A Sunny traitor in Chaos?" said Zabini, sounding puzzled. "But all the ones I
    knew about were supposed to strike during Chaos's attack on Sunshine -"
6670:
  text: |-
    "No!" said Padma in a tone of sudden realization. "That was <em>Chaos</em>
    executing a spy!"
6671:
  text: |-
    "<em>What?</em> " said Zabini. "But why -"
6672:
  text: |-
    And Draco got it. <em>Damn it!</em> "Because Potter thinks he's safe for how
    much he beats Sunshine, but not for how much he beats <em>us!</em> So he doesn't
    want to lose a single point when he executes a traitor! <em>General order!</em>
    If you have to execute a traitor, call Sunshine first! And don't forget to
    switch back to Dragon afterward -"

6674:
  text: |-
    Longbottom's body drifted chaotically through the water, arms and legs
    disarrayed. After Draco had finally got a hit in they'd all shot him
    <em>again</em> just to be sure.
6675:
  text: |-
    Nearby was Harry Potter, now protected by a Prismatic Sphere, looking at them
    all grimly as the last sliver of crescent moon slowly diminished, somewhere far
    away. If Longbottom had managed to shoot one more soldier (Draco knew Harry was
    thinking), if the two Chaotics had managed to hold out just a little longer,
    they might have <em>won</em>...
6676:
  text: |-
    After Draco had reformed his forces and struck out again, the ensuing battle and
    execution of spies in Sunshine's name had left Sunshine exactly one point ahead
    of Dragon and Chaos both. Once Harry had started doing it, Draco had been left
    with no choice but to follow suit.
6677:
  text: |-
    But now they had General Chaos outnumbered three to one, the survivors of Dragon
    Army and the last remaining Sunny traitor: Draco, and Padma, and Zabini.
6678:
  text: |-
    And Draco, who was no fool, had ordered Padma to take Zabini's wand after
    Longbottom had shot Gregory and fallen in turn to Draco. The boy had given him
    an insulted look, told Draco that he owed him for this, and handed it over.
6679:
  text: |-
    That left Draco and Padma to take down General Chaos.
6680:
  text: |-
    "I don't suppose you'd like to surrender?" said Draco, smiling as evilly as any
    smile he'd ever directed at Harry Potter.
6681:
  text: |-
    "Sleep before surrender!" shouted General Chaos.
6682:
  text: |-
    "Just so you know," said Draco, "Zabini doesn't actually <em>have</em> an older
    sister for you to rescue from Gryffindor bullies. But Zabini <em>does</em> have
    a mother who doesn't approve of Muggleborns like Granger, and I wrote her a few
    notes, and offered Zabini a few favors - nothing involving my father, just
    things <em>I</em> can do in school. And by the way, Zabini's mother doesn't
    approve of the Boy-Who-Lived, either. Just in case you still thought Zabini was
    really on your side."
6683:
  text: |-
    Harry's face grew even grimmer.
6684:
  text: |-
    Draco raised his wand, and began breathing rhythmically, building up strength
    for a Breaking Drill Hex. Granger's Prismatic Sphere was almost as strong as
    Draco's now, and Harry's wasn't much weaker, where did those two find
    <em>time?</em>
6685:
  text: |-
    "<em>Lagann!</em> " spoke Draco, putting everything he had into it, and the
    green spiral blazed out and Harry's shield shattered, and at almost the same
    moment -
6686:
  text: |-
    "<em>Somnium!</em> " said Padma.
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
6687:
  text: |-
    <em>Granger: 253 / Malfoy: 252 / Potter: 254</em>
6688:
  text: |-
    Harry let out a long breath of relief, and not just because he didn't have to
    hold the Prismatic Sphere any more. His hand was shaking as he lowered his wand.
6689:
  text: |-
    "You know," said Harry, "I was pretty worried there for a moment."
6690:
  text: |-
    <em>Special Order Two: If a Sunny traitor doesn't seem to be really shooting at
    you, fake being hit occasionally. Prefer targeting Dragons to Sunnies but go
    ahead and shoot Sunnies if you can't shoot Dragons.</em>
6691:
  text: |-
    <em>Special Order Three: Merlin says do not shoot at Blaise Zabini or either
    Patil twin.</em>
6692:
  text: |-
    With a wide grin, Parvati Patil stripped the Transfigured patch off her
    uniform's insignia, and let it float away in the water.
6693:
  text: |-
    "Gryffindors for Chaos," she said, and handed Zabini his wand back.
6694:
  text: |-
    "Thank you <em>very</em> much," Harry said, and bowed sweepingly to the
    Gryffindor girl. "And thank <em>you</em> as well," bowing to Zabini. "You know,
    when you came to me with that plan, I wondered if you were brilliant or crazy,
    and I've decided that you're both. And by the way," Harry said, now turning as
    though to address Draco's body, "Zabini <em>does</em> have a cousin -"
6695:
  text: |-
    "<em>Somnium,</em>" said Zabini's voice.

6696:
  text: |-
    <em>Granger: 255 / Malfoy: 252 / Potter: 254</em>
6697:

    And Harry Potter's body floated away, his expression of shock and horror quickly
    relaxing into sleep.
6698:
  text: |-
    "On second thought," Parvati said cheerfully, "make that Gryffindors for
    Sunshine."
6699:
  text: |-
    She started to laugh, more exhiliarated than she'd ever been in her life, she'd
    <em>finally</em> gotten to assassinate and replace her twin sister and she'd
    wanted to do that since <em>forever,</em> and this had been <em>perfect,</em> it
    had all been <em>perfect</em> -
6700:
  text: |-
    - and then her wand spun around in a lightning motion just as Zabini's wand
    turned to point at her.
6701:
  text: |-
    "Wait!" said Zabini. "Do not shoot, do not resist. That's an order."
6702:
  text: |-
    "<em>What?</em> " said Parvati.
6703:
  text: |-
    "Sorry," said Zabini, looking not-quite-sincerely apologetic, "but I can't be
    totally <em>sure</em> you're for Sunshine. So I order you to let me shoot you."
6704:
  text: |-
    "<em>Hold on!</em> " said Parvati. "We're only ahead of Chaos by one point! If
    you shoot me now -"
6705:
  text: |-
    "I'll shoot you in the name of Dragon, <em>obviously</em>," said Zabini, now
    sounding a little superior. "Just because we tricked <em>them</em> into doing
    it, doesn't mean it won't work for us."
6706:
  text: |-
    Parvati stared at him, her eyes narrowing. "General Malfoy said your mother
    doesn't like Hermione."
6707:
  text: |-
    "I suppose," said Zabini, still with that superior smirk. "But some of us are
    more willing than Draco Malfoy to annoy a parent."
6708:
  text: |-
    "And Harry Potter said you have a cousin -"
6709:
  text: |-
    "Nope," said Zabini.
6710:
  text: |-
    Parvati stared at him, trying to think, but she wasn't really good at plotting;
    Zabini'd said the plan was to secretly keep the scores of Chaos and Dragon as
    even as possible so they'd use Sunshine's name to execute their traitors instead
    of losing even a single point, and that had <em>worked</em>... but... she had
    the feeling she was missing something, she wasn't a Slytherin...
6711:
  text: |-
    "Why don't <em>I</em> shoot <em>you</em> in the name of Dragon?" said Parvati.
6712:
  text: |-
    "Because I outrank you," said Zabini.
6713:
  text: |-
    Parvati had a bad feeling about this.
6714:
  text: |-
    She stared at him for a long moment.
6715:
  text: |-
    And then -
6716:
  text: |-
    "<em>Somni-</em>" she started to say, and then realized she hadn't said <em>for
    Dragon,</em> and frantically cut herself off -

    "Hey, everyone," said Blaise Zabini's face on the screens, looking quite amused,
    "guess it's all down to me."
6719:
  text: |-
    All by the lakeside, people were holding their breath.
6720:
  text: |-
    Sunshine was ahead of Dragon and Chaos by exactly one point.
6721:
  text: |-
    Blaise Zabini could shoot himself in the name of either Dragon or Chaos, or just
    leave things the way they were.
6722:
  text: |-
    A series of chimes indicated that the last minute of time was running out.
6723:
  text: |-
    And the Slytherin was smiling a strange, twisted smile, and casually toying with
    his wand, the dark wood barely visible in the dark water.
6724:
  text: |-
    "You know," said Blaise Zabini's voice, in the tones of someone who'd been
    rehearsing the words for a while, "it's just a game, really. And games are
    supposed to be <em>fun.</em> So how about if I just do whatever I feel like?"
