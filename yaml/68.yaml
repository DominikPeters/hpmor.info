    Hermione wasn't feeling very nice right now, or Good either, there was a hot
    ball of anger burning inside her and she wondered if this was something like
    Harry's darkness (though it probably wasn't even close) and she shouldn't have
    felt that way over some silly little game but -
11655:

    Her whole army. Two soldiers had beaten her whole army. That was what she'd been
    told after she woke up.
11656:
  text: |-
    It was a little too much.
11657:
  text: |-
    "Well," Professor Quirrell said. From up close the Defense Professor didn't look
    quite as healthy as he had the last time she'd been in his office; his skin
    looked paler, and he moved a little slower. His expression was as stern as ever,
    and his gaze as penetrating; his fingers tapped sharply on his desk, rap-rap. "I
    would guess that of the three of you, only Mr. Malfoy has guessed why I've asked
    you here."
11658:
  text: |-
    "Something to do with Noble and Most Ancient Houses?" said Harry from beside
    her, sounding puzzled. "I didn't violate some kind of crazy law by firing on
    Daphne, did I?"
11659:
  text: |-
    "Not quite," the man said with heavy irony. "Since Miss Greengrass did not
    invoke the correct dueling forms, she is not entitled to demand that you be
    stripped of your House name. Although of course I would not have permitted a
    formal duel. Wars do not respect such rules." The Defense Professor leaned
    forward and rested his chin on steepled hands, as though sitting upright had
    already tired him. His eyes gazed at them, sharp and dangerous. "General Malfoy.
    Why did I call you here?"
11660:
  text: |-
    "General Potter against the two of us isn't a fair fight anymore," Draco Malfoy
    said in a quiet voice.
11661:
  text: |-
    "<em>What?</em> " blurted Hermione. "We almost <em>had</em> them, if Daphne
    hadn't fainted -"
11662:
  text: |-
    "Miss Greengrass did not faint from magical exhaustion," Professor Quirrell said
    dryly. "Mr. Potter shot her in the back with a Sleep Hex while your soldiers
    were distracted by the sight of their general flying into a wall. But
    congratulations nonetheless, Miss Granger, on <em>almost</em> defeating two
    Chaotic Legionnaires with a mere twenty-four Sunshine Soldiers."
11663:
  text: |-
    The blood flaming in her cheeks grew a little hotter. "That - that was just - if
    I'd only figured out he was wearing armor -"
11664:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell gazed at her from over touched fingers. "Of course there are
    ways you <em>could</em> have won, Miss Granger. There always are, in every lost
    battle. The world around us redunds with opportunities, explodes with
    opportunities, which nearly all folk ignore because it would require them to
    violate a habit of thought; in every battle a thousand Hufflepuff bones waiting
    to be sharpened into spears. If you had thought to try a massed <em>Finite
    Incantatem</em> on general principles, you would have dispelled Mr. Potter's
    suit of chainmail and everything else he was wearing except his underwear, which
    leads me to suspect that Mr. Potter did not quite realize his own vulnerability.
    Or you could have had your soldiers swarm Mr. Potter and Mr. Longbottom and
    physically wrest the wands from their hands. Mr. Malfoy's own response was not
    what I would term <em>well-reasoned,</em> but at least he did not wholly ignore
    his thousand alternatives." A sardonic smile. "But you, Miss Granger, had the
    misfortune to remember how to cast the Stunning Hex, and so you did not search
    your excellent memory for a dozen easier spells that might have proved
    efficacious. And you pinned all your army's hopes on your own person, so they
    lost spirit when you fell. Afterward they continued to cast their futile Sleep
    Hexes, governed by the habits of fighting that had been trained into them,
    unable to break the pattern as Mr. Malfoy did. I cannot quite comprehend what
    goes through people's minds when they repeat the same failed strategy over and
    over, but apparently it is an astonishingly rare realization that you can try
    something else. And so the Sunshine Regiment was wiped out by two soldiers." The
    Defense Professor grinned mirthlessly. "One perceives certain similarities to
    how fifty Death Eaters dominated all of magical Britain, and how our much-loved
    Ministry continues in its rule."
11665:
  text: |-
    The Defense Professor sighed. "<em>Nonetheless,</em> Miss Granger, the fact
    remains that this is not the first such defeat for you. In the previous battle,
    you and Mr. Malfoy united your forces, and yet you were fought to a standstill,
    so that you and Mr. Malfoy had to pursue Mr. Potter onto the roof. The Chaos
    Legion has now demonstrated, twice in succession, military strength equal to
    both other armies combined. This leaves me no choice. General Potter, you will
    select eight soldiers from your army, including at least one Chaotic Lieutenant,
    to be divided among Dragon Army and the Sunshine Regiment -"
11666:
  text: |-
    "<em>What?</em> " Hermione burst out again, she glanced over at the other
    generals and saw that Harry looked as shocked as her, while Draco Malfoy only
    looked resigned.
11667:
  text: |-
    "General Potter is stronger than both of you together," Professor Quirrell said
    with calm precision. "Your contest is over, he has won, and it is time to
    rebalance the three armies to present him with a renewed challenge."
11668:
  text: |-
    "<em>Professor Quirrell!</em> " said Harry. "I didn't -"
11669:
  text: |-
    "This is my decision as the Professor of Battle Magic at the Hogwarts School of
    Witchcraft and Wizardry and it is not subject to negotiation." The words were
    still precise, but the look in Professor Quirrell's eyes chilled Hermione's
    blood, even though he was glaring at Harry and not at her. "And I find it
    <em>suspicious</em>, Mr. Potter, that the moment you wished to isolate Miss
    Granger and Mr. Malfoy and force them to chase you onto the roof, you were able
    to annihilate just exactly as much of their united force as you pleased. Indeed,
    that is the level of performance I <em>expected</em> of you since the start of
    this year, and I am <em>annoyed</em> to discover that you have been holding back
    in my classes this entire time! I have seen what you can truly do, Mr. Potter.
    You are far beyond the point where Mr. Malfoy or Miss Granger can fight you on
    an equal level, and you will not be permitted to pretend otherwise. This, Mr.
    Potter, I tell you in my capacity as your professor: For you to learn to your
    full potential, you must exercise your full abilities and not hold back for
    <em>any</em> reason - particularly not childish frets over what your friends
    might think!"

    She left the Defense Professor's office with a larger army, and less dignity,
    and feeling a lot like a sad little bug that had just been squished, and trying
    very very hard not to cry.
11671:
  text: |-
    "I <em>wasn't</em> holding back!" Harry said as soon as they turned the first
    corner away from Professor Quirrell's office, the moment the wooden door faded
    out of sight behind the stone walls. "I wasn't pretending, I never <em>let</em>
    either of you win!"
11672:
  text: |-
    She didn't answer, couldn't answer, it would all break loose if she tried to say
    a word.
11673:
  text: |-
    "Really?" said Draco Malfoy. The Dragon General still had that air of
    resignation. "Because Quirrell's right, you know, it's <em>suspicious</em> that
    you could beat nearly everyone in both our armies as soon as you wanted to make
    us chase you onto the roof. And didn't you say something then, Potter, about us
    needing to beat you when you were fighting for real?"
11674:
  text: |-
    The burning sensation was creeping up her throat, and when it reached her eyes
    she would burst into tears, and from then on she would be just a crying little
    girl to both of them.
11675:
  text: |-
    "That -" Harry's voice said urgently, she wasn't looking at him but his voice
    sounded like he had his head turned toward her. "That was - I tried a lot harder
    that time, there was an important reason, I <em>had</em> to, so I used a whole
    bunch of tricks I'd been saving up - and -"
11676:
  text: |-
    She'd always been trying her hardest, every time.
11677:
  text: |-
    "- and I, I let out a side of myself I wouldn't usually use for something like
    Defense class -"
11678:
  text: |-
    So if she ever got close to winning against Harry when it <em>really</em>
    mattered, he could just go into his dark side and crush her, was that it?
11679:
  text: |-
    ...of course it was. She couldn't even <em>look</em> Harry in the eyes when he
    was being scary, how had she ever thought she could beat him for real?
11680:
  text: |-
    The corridor forked, and Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy went left toward a
    staircase that climbed to the second floor, and she went right instead, she
    didn't even know where that passage went but right now she'd rather be lost in
    the castle.
11681:
  text: |-
    "Excuse me, Draco," said Harry's voice, and then there was a pattering of
    footsteps behind her.
11682:
  text: |-
    "Leave me alone," she said, it came out sounding stern but then she had to shut
    her mouth and press her lips together tightly and hold her breath to stop it all
    from coming out.
11683:
  text: |-
    That boy just kept on coming, and ran around her and put himself in front of
    her, because he was stupid that was why, and Harry said, his voice now a high
    and desperate whisper, "I didn't run away when <em>you</em> were beating
    <em>me</em> in all my classes except broomstick riding!"
11684:
  text: |-
    He didn't understand, and he would never understand, Harry Potter would never
    understand, because no matter what contest he lost he would still be the Boy-
    Who-Lived, if you were Harry Potter and Hermione Granger was beating you then it
    meant everyone was expecting you to rise to the challenge, if you were Hermione
    Granger and Harry Potter was beating you that meant you were just no one.
11685:
  text: |-
    "It's not fair," she said, her voice was shaking but she wasn't crying yet, not
    yet, "<em>I</em> shouldn't have to fight your dark side, I'm just - I'm only -"
    <em>I'm only twelve,</em> that was what she thought then.
11686:
  text: |-
    "I only used my dark side <em>once</em> and that was - when I <em>had</em> to!"
11687:
  text: |-
    "So today you beat my <em>whole army</em> being just Harry?" She still wasn't
    crying yet, and she wondered what her face looked like right now, if she looked
    like an angry Hermione or a sad one.
11688:
  text: |-
    "I -" Harry said. His voice got a little lower, "I wasn't... really
    <em>expecting</em> to win, that time, I know I said I was invincible but that
    was just to try to scare you, I really just thought we'd slow you down for a bit
    -"
11689:
  text: |-
    She started walking again, walked right past him, and as she passed Harry's face
    tightened up like <em>he</em> was going to cry.
11690:
  text: |-
    "Is Professor Quirrell right?" came a high desperate whisper from behind her.
    "If I have you for a friend, will I always be afraid to do better because I know
    it will hurt your feelings? That's not fair, Hermione!"
11691:
  text: |-
    She took a breath and held it and ran, her feet pattering across the stone as
    fast as they could, running as fast as she dared with her vision all blurry, ran
    so that no one would hear her, and this time Harry didn't follow.

    Minerva was going over the Transfiguration parchment due Monday, and had just
    marked down to negative two hundred points a fifth-year parchment with an error
    that could have potentially killed someone. During her first year as a professor
    she'd been indignant at the folly of older students, now she was just resigned.
    Some people not only never learned, they never noticed that they were hopeless,
    they stayed bright and eager and kept on trying. Sometimes they believed you
    when you told them, before they left Hogwarts, that they must <em>never</em> try
    anything unusual, give up free Transfiguration and use the art only through
    established Charms; and sometimes... they didn't.

    She was in the middle of trying to unravel a particularly convoluted answer when
    a knock at the door disrupted her thoughts; and it wasn't her office hours, but
    it had only taken a very short time as Head of Gryffindor House for her to learn
    to suspend judgment. You could always deduct House points <em>afterward.</em>
11694:
  text: |-
    "Come in," she said in a crisp voice.
11695:
  text: |-
    The young girl who entered her office had clearly been crying, and then
    afterward had washed her face in hopes it wouldn't show -
11696:
  text: |-
    "Miss Granger!" said Professor McGonagall. It had taken her a moment to
    recognize that face with its eyes reddened and cheeks puffed. "What happened?"
11697:
  text: |-
    "Professor," said the young girl in a wavering voice, "you said that if I was
    ever worried or uncomfortable about anything, I should come to you at once -"
11698:
  text: |-
    "Yes," said Professor McGonagall, "now what <em>happened?</em> "
11699:

    The girl started to explain -

    Hermione stood still and the stairs turned around her, a revolving helix that
    shouldn't have taken her anywhere at all, and instead bore her continuously
    <em>upward.</em> Hermione thought it seemed like the Enchantment of the Endless
    Stair, which had been invented in 1733 by the wizard Arram Sabeti who'd lived on
    top of Mount Everest in the days when no Muggles could climb it. Only that
    couldn't be right because Hogwarts was much older - maybe the enchantment had
    been <em>re</em>invented?
11701:

    She should've been frightened, should've been nervous about her second meeting
    with the Headmaster.
11702:
  text: |-
    She <em>was</em>, in fact, frightened and nervous about her second meeting with
    the Headmaster.
11703:
  text: |-
    Only Hermione Granger had been thinking; she'd been thinking a lot, after she
    hadn't been able to run any further and had slid down against the wall with her
    lungs on fire, thinking while she curled up in a ball with her back against the
    chilly stone wall and her legs drawn up and crying.
11704:
  text: |-
    Even if she lost to Harry Potter she was never, ever going to lose to Draco
    Malfoy, that was just totally <em>absolutely</em> unacceptable, and Professor
    Quirrell had praised General Malfoy for not ignoring his thousand alternatives;
    and so after Hermione had cried herself out she'd thought of fourteen other
    spells she <em>should've</em> tried against Harry and Neville, and then she'd
    started wondering if she might be making the same sort of mistake about other
    things; and that was how she'd ended up knocking on Professor McGonagall's door.
    Not asking for help, right now Hermione didn't have any plans she could ask for
    help <em>with,</em> just telling Professor McGonagall everything, because when
    she'd thought of it that had seemed like one of the thousand alternatives that
    Professor Quirrell had been talking about.
11705:
  text: |-
    And she'd told Professor McGonagall about how Harry Potter had changed since the
    day the phoenix had been on his shoulder, and about how people more and more
    seemed to see her as just something of Harry's, and how it seemed like Harry was
    pulling farther and farther away from everyone else in their school year and
    went around with a sad air sometimes like he was losing something, and <em>she
    didn't know what to do anymore.</em>
11706:
  text: |-
    And Professor McGonagall had told her that they needed to talk to the
    Headmaster.
11707:
  text: |-
    And Hermione had felt worried, but then the thought had come to her that
    <em>Harry Potter</em> wouldn't have been scared of the Headmaster. Harry Potter
    would have just barged ahead doing whatever he was trying to do. Maybe (the
    thought had come to her) it was worth <em>trying</em> to be like that,
    <em>not</em> being scared, just doing whatever, and seeing what happened to her,
    it couldn't really be worse.
11708:

    The Endless Stair stopped turning.
11709:
  text: |-
    The great oaken door in front of them with the brass griffin knocker opened
    without being touched.
11710:
  text: |-
    Behind a black oaken desk with dozens of drawers facing in every direction,
    looking like it had drawers set <em>inside</em> other drawers, was the silver-
    bearded Headmaster of Hogwarts upon his throne, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian
    Dumbledore, into whose gently twinkling eyes Hermione looked for around three
    seconds before she was distracted by all the other things in the room.
11711:
  text: |-
    Some time later - she wasn't sure how long but it was while she was trying to
    count the number of things in the room for the third time and <em>still</em> not
    getting the same answer, even though her memory insisted that nothing had been
    added or removed - the Headmaster cleared his throat and said, "Miss Granger?"
11712:
  text: |-
    Hermione's head snapped around, and she felt a little heat in her cheeks; but
    Dumbledore didn't appear annoyed with her at all, only serene, and with an
    inquiring look in those mild, half-glassed eyes.
11713:
  text: |-
    "Hermione," said Professor McGonagall, the older witch's voice was gentle and
    her hand rested reassuringly on Hermione's shoulder, "please tell the Headmaster
    what you said to me about Harry."
11714:
  text: |-
    Hermione began speaking, despite her newfound resolution her voice still
    stumbled a little with nervousness, as she described how Harry had changed in
    the last few weeks since Fawkes had been on his shoulder.
11715:
  text: |-
    When she was done there was a pause, and then the Headmaster sighed. "I am
    sorry, Hermione Granger," said Dumbledore. Those blue eyes had grown sadder as
    she spoke. "That is... unfortunate, but I cannot say it is unexpected. That is a
    hero's burden, which you see."
11716:
  text: |-
    "A <em>hero?</em> " said Hermione. She looked up nervously at Professor
    McGonagall and saw that the Transfiguration Professor's face had grown tight,
    though her hand still squeezed Hermione's shoulder reassuringly.
11717:
  text: |-
    "Yes," said Dumbledore. "I was a hero myself once, before I was a mysterious old
    wizard, in the days when I opposed Grindelwald. You have read history books,
    Miss Granger?"
11718:
  text: |-
    Hermione nodded.
11719:
  text: |-
    "Well," said Dumbledore, "that is what heroes have to do, Miss Granger, they
    have their tasks and they must grow strong to accomplish them, and that is what
    you see happening to Harry. If there is anything that can be done to gentle his
    pathway, then <em>you</em> will be the one to do it, and not I. For I am not
    Harry's friend, alas, but only his mysterious old wizard."
11720:
  text: |-
    "I -" said Hermione. "I'm not sure - I still want to be -" Her voice stopped, it
    seemed too awful to say aloud.
11721:
  text: |-
    Dumbledore closed his eyes, and when he opened them, he looked a little older
    than before. "No one can stop you, Miss Granger, if you choose to stop being
    Harry's friend. As for what it would do to him, you may know that better than
    I."
11722:
  text: |-
    "That - doesn't seem <em>fair,</em>" Hermione said, her voice trembling. "That
    I've <em>got</em> to be Harry's friend because he's got no one else? That
    doesn't seem fair."
11723:
  text: |-
    "<em>Being</em> a friend is not something you can be forced to, Miss Granger."
    The blue eyes seemed to look right through her. "The feelings are there, or they
    are not. If they are there, you can accept them or deny them. You <em>are</em>
    Harry's friend - and choosing to deny it would wound him terribly, perhaps
    beyond healing. But Miss Granger, what would drive you to such extremes?"
11724:
  text: |-
    She couldn't find words. She'd never been able to find words. "If you get too
    near Harry - you get <em>swallowed up,</em> and no one sees <em>you</em> any
    more, you're just something of <em>his,</em> everyone thinks the whole world
    revolves around him and..." She didn't have the words.
11725:
  text: |-
    The old wizard nodded slowly. "It is indeed an unjust world we live in, Miss
    Granger. All the world now knows that it is I who defeated Grindelwald, and
    fewer remember Elizabeth Beckett who died opening the way so I could pass
    through. And yet she is remembered. Harry Potter <em>is</em> the hero of this
    play, Miss Granger; the world <em>does</em> revolve around him. He is destined
    for great things; and I ween that in time the name of Albus Dumbledore will be
    remembered as Harry Potter's mysterious old wizard, more than for anything else
    I have done. And perhaps the name of Hermione Granger will be remembered as his
    companion, if you prove worthy of it in your day. For this I tell you true:
    never will you find more glory on your own, than in Harry Potter's company."
11726:
  text: |-
    Hermione shook her head rapidly. "But that's <em>not</em> -" She'd known she
    wouldn't be able to explain. "It's not about <em>glory,</em> it's about being -
    something that belongs to someone else!"
11727:
  text: |-
    "So you think you would rather be the hero?" The old wizard sighed. "Miss
    Granger, I have <em>been</em> a hero, and a leader; and I would have been a
    thousand times happier if I could have belonged to someone like Harry Potter.
    Someone made of sterner stuff than I, to make the hard decisions, and yet worthy
    to lead me. I thought, once, that I knew such a man, but I was mistaken... Miss
    Granger, you have no idea at <em>all</em> how fortunate are those like you,
    compared to heroes."
11728:
  text: |-
    The hot burning feeling was creeping up her throat again, along with
    helplessness, she didn't understand why Professor McGonagall had brought her
    here if the Headmaster wasn't going to help, and from a glance at Professor
    McGonagall's face, it looked like Professor McGonagall also wasn't sure now that
    it had been a good idea.
11729:
  text: |-
    "I don't want to be a hero," said Hermione Granger, "I don't want to be a hero's
    companion, I just want to be <em>me.</em>"
11730:
  text: |-
    (The thought came to her a few seconds later that maybe she <em>did</em> in fact
    want to be a hero, but she decided not to change what she'd said.)
11731:
  text: |-
    "Ah," said the old wizard. "That is a tall order, Miss Granger." Dumbledore rose
    from his throne, stepped out behind his desk, and pointed to a symbol on the
    wall, so ubiquitous that Hermione's eyes had glossed right over it; a faded
    shield on which was inscribed the heraldry of Hogwarts, the lion and snake, and
    badger and raven, and in Latin engraved words whose point she'd never
    understood. Then, as she realized where that shield was, and how old it looked,
    it suddenly occurred to Hermione that this might be the <em>original</em> -
11732:
  text: |-
    "A Hufflepuff would say," said Dumbledore, tapping his finger on the faded
    badger and making Hermione wince for the sacrilege (if it <em>was</em> the
    original), "that people fail to become who they are meant to be, because they
    are too lazy to put in all the work involved. A Ravenclaw," tapping the raven,
    "would repeat those words that the wise know to be far older than Socrates,
    <em>know thyself,</em> and say that people fail to become who they are meant to
    be, through ignorance and lack of thought. And Salazar Slytherin," Dumbledore
    frowned as his finger tapped the faded snake, "why, he said that we become who
    we are meant to be by following our desires wherever they lead. Perhaps he would
    say that people fail to become themselves because they refuse to do what is
    necessary to achieve their ambitions. But then one notes that nearly all of the
    Dark Wizards to come out of Hogwarts have been Slytherins. Did they become what
    they were meant to be? I think not." Dumbledore's finger tapped the lion, and
    then he turned toward her. "Tell me, Miss Granger, what would a Gryffindor say?
    I do not need to ask whether the Sorting Hat offered you that House."
11733:
  text: |-
    It didn't seem like a hard question. "A Gryffindor would say that people don't
    become who they should be, because they're afraid."
11734:
  text: |-
    "Most people <em>are</em> afraid, Miss Granger," said the old wizard. "They live
    their whole lives circumscribed by crippling fear that cuts off everything they
    might accomplish, everything they might become. Fear of saying or doing the
    wrong thing, fear of losing their mere possessions, fear of death, and above all
    the fear of what other people will think of them. Such fear is a most terrible
    thing, Miss Granger, and it is terribly important to know that. But it is not
    what Godric Gryffindor would have said. People become who they are meant to be,
    Miss Granger, by doing what is right." The old wizard's voice was gentle. "So
    tell me, Miss Granger, what seems to you like the <em>right</em> choice? For
    <em>that</em> is who you truly are, and wherever that path leads, that is who
    you are meant to become."

    There was a long space filled with the sounds of things that could not be
    counted.
11736:
  text: |-
    She thought about it, because she was a Ravenclaw.
11737:
  text: |-
    "I don't <em>think</em> it's right," Hermione said slowly, "for someone to have
    to live inside someone else's shadow like that..."
11738:
  text: |-
    "Many things in the world are not right," said the old wizard, "the question is
    what is right for <em>you</em> to do about them. Hermione Granger, I shall be
    less subtle than is usual for a mysterious old wizard, and tell you outright
    that you cannot <em>imagine</em> how badly things could go if the events
    surrounding Harry Potter turn to ill. His quest is a matter you would not even
    <em>dream</em> of walking away from, if you knew."
11739:
  text: |-
    "<em>What</em> quest?" said Hermione. Her voice was trembling, because it was
    very clear what answer the Headmaster was looking for and she didn't want to
    give it. "What <em>happened</em> to Harry back then, <em>why</em> was Fawkes on
    his shoulder?"
11740:
  text: |-
    "He grew up," said the old wizard. His eyes blinked several times, beneath the
    half-moon glasses, and his face suddenly looked very lined. "You see, Miss
    Granger, people do not grow up because of time, people grow up when they are
    placed in grownup situations. That is what happened to Harry Potter that
    Saturday. He was told - you are not to share this information with anyone, you
    understand - he was told that he would have to fight someone. I cannot tell you
    who. I cannot tell you why. But that is what happened to him, and why he needs
    his friends."
11741:
  text: |-
    There was a pause.
11742:
  text: |-
    "<em>Bellatrix Black?</em> " Hermione said. She couldn't have been more shocked
    if someone had plugged an electrical cord into her ear. "You're going to make
    Harry fight <em>Bellatrix Black?</em> "
11743:
  text: |-
    "No," said the old wizard. "Not her. I cannot tell you who, or why."
11744:
  text: |-
    She thought about it some more.
11745:
  text: |-
    "Is there any way I can <em>keep up</em> with Harry?" said Hermione. "I mean,
    I'm not saying it's what I'll <em>do</em>, but - if he needs friends then can we
    be <em>equal</em> friends? Can I be a hero too?"
11746:
  text: |-
    "Ah," said the old wizard, and smiled. "Only you can decide that, Miss Granger."
11747:
  text: |-
    "But you're not going to help me like you're helping Harry."
11748:
  text: |-
    The old wizard shook his head. "I have helped him little enough, Miss Granger.
    And if you are asking me for a quest -" The old wizard smiled again, rather
    wryly. "Miss Granger, you are in your first year of Hogwarts. Do not be too
    eager to grow up; there will be time enough for that later."
11749:
  text: |-
    "I'm twelve. Harry's <em>eleven.</em>"
11750:
  text: |-
    "Harry Potter is special," said the old wizard. "As you know, Miss Granger." The
    blue eyes were suddenly piercing beneath the half-moon glasses, and she was
    reminded of the day of the Dementor when Dumbledore's voice had said, inside her
    mind, that he knew about Harry's dark side.
11751:
  text: |-
    Hermione put up her hand and touched Professor McGonagall's hand, which had
    stayed strong on her shoulder this whole time, and Hermione said, she was
    surprised that her voice didn't break, "I'd like to go, now, please."
11752:
  text: |-
    "Of course," said Professor McGonagall, and Hermione felt the hand on her
    shoulder gently turning her around to face the oaken door.
11753:
  text: |-
    "Have you chosen your path yet, Hermione Granger?" said Albus Dumbledore's voice
    from behind her, even as the door slowly creaked open to reveal the Enchantment
    of the Endless Stair.
11754:
  text: |-
    She nodded.
11755:
  text: |-
    "And?"
11756:
  text: |-
    "I'll," she said, her voice stuck, "I'll, I'll -"
11757:
  text: |-
    She swallowed.
11758:
  text: |-
    "I'll do - what's right -"
11759:
  text: |-
    She didn't say anything else, she couldn't, and then the Endless Stair began
    revolving around her once again.
11760:
  text: |-
    Neither she nor Professor McGonagall spoke on the way down.
11761:
  text: |-
    When the Flowing Stone gargoyles stepped out of their way, and the two of them
    stepped out into the corridors of Hogwarts, Professor McGonagall finally spoke,
    and she said in a whisper, "I'm so terribly sorry, Miss Granger. I did not think
    the Headmaster would say such things to you. I think he truly has forgotten what
    it is like to be a child."
11762:
  text: |-
    Hermione glanced back up to her and saw that Professor McGonagall looked like
    <em>she</em> was about to burst into tears... only not really, but there was a
    tightness in her face that was like that.
11763:
  text: |-
    "If I want to be a hero too," said Hermione, "if I've decided to be a hero too,
    is there anything <em>you</em> can do to help?"
11764:
  text: |-
    Professor McGonagall rapidly shook her head, and said, "Miss Granger, I'm not
    sure the Headmaster is wrong about <em>that.</em> You <em>are</em> twelve."
11765:
  text: |-
    "Okay," said Hermione.
11766:
  text: |-
    They walked forward a bit.
11767:
  text: |-
    "Excuse me," said Hermione, "is it okay if I walk back to the Ravenclaw tower by
    myself? I'm sorry, it's not your fault or anything, I just want to be by myself
    right now."
11768:
  text: |-
    "Of course, Miss Granger," said Professor McGonagall, her voice sounding a
    little hoarse, and Hermione heard her footsteps stop, and then turn around
    behind her.
11769:
  text: |-
    Hermione Granger walked away.
11770:
  text: |-
    She climbed a flight of stairs, and then another, wondering if there was anyone
    else in Hogwarts who would give her a chance to be a hero. Professor Flitwick
    would say the same thing as Professor McGonagall, and even if he didn't, he
    probably couldn't help, Hermione didn't know who <em>could</em> help. Well,
    Professor Quirrell would come up with something clever if she used up enough
    Quirrell points, but she had a feeling that asking him would be a bad idea -
    that the Defense Professor couldn't help anyone become the sort of hero that was
    worth becoming, and that he wouldn't even understand the difference.
11771:

    She had almost gotten to the Ravenclaw tower when she saw the flash of gold.
