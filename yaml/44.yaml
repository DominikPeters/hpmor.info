    "Fawkes," said Albus Dumbledore, his voice cracking, "help him, please -"
7986:
  text: |-
    A brilliant creature of red-gold shuffled into the field of vision, looking down
    quizzically; and it began to croon.
7987:
  text: |-
    The meaningless chirps slid off the emptiness, there was nothing onto which they
    could hold.
7988:
  text: |-
    "You're noisy," said the voice, "you should die."
7989:
  text: |-
    "Chocolate," Albus Dumbledore said, "you need chocolate, and your friends - but
    I dare not take you back -"
7990:
  text: |-
    Then a shining raven came, and spoke in Professor Flitwick's voice; whereupon
    Albus Dumbledore gasped in sudden comprehension, and cursed aloud at his own
    stupidity.
7991:
  text: |-
    The empty thing laughed at that, for it had retained the capacity to be amused.
7992:
  text: |-
    And a moment later they had all vanished in another flash of fire.

7993:
  text: |-
    It was only a moment, it seemed, between when Flitwick's raven had flown to
    elsewhere, and when Albus Dumbledore reappeared in another crack of red and
    golden fire with Harry in his arms; but somehow in that time Hermione had
    already managed to fill her hands with chocolate.
7994:
  text: |-
    Before Hermione even got there, chocolate had zoomed off the table and straight
    into Harry's mouth, which a tiny part of her mind said was unfair, <em>he'd</em>
    gotten a chance to do it for <em>her -</em>
7995:
  text: |-
    Harry spat the chocolate back out again.
7996:
  text: |-
    "Go away," said a voice so empty it wasn't even cold.
7997:
  text: |-
    ...
7998:
  text: |-
    Everything seemed to freeze, everyone who had been moving toward Harry halted,
    all movements broken by the shock of those two dead words.
7999:
  text: |-
    Then: "No," said Albus Dumbledore, "I will not," and time resumed again, even as
    another piece of chocolate zoomed off the table and into Harry's mouth.
8000:
  text: |-
    Hermione was close enough now that she could see Harry's expression become more
    hateful, as his mouth chewed with a mechanical, unnatural rhythm.
8001:
  text: |-
    The Headmaster's voice was grim as iron. "Filius, call Minerva, tell her she
    must come at speed."
8002:
  text: |-
    Professor Flitwick whispered to his silver raven, and it flew into the air and
    vanished.
8003:
  text: |-
    Another piece of chocolate floated into Harry's mouth, and the mechanical
    chewing continued.
8004:
  text: |-
    There were more students gathering around where the Headmaster watched over
    Harry with grim eyes: Neville, Seamus, Dean, Lavender, Ernie, Terry, Anthony,
    none of them daring to approach any closer than Hermione had.
8005:
  text: |-
    "What can we do?" said Dean in a trembling voice.
8006:
  text: |-
    "Back off and give him more space -" said the dry voice of Professor Quirrell.
8007:
  text: |-
    "No!" interrupted the Headmaster. "Let him be surrounded by his friends."
8008:
  text: |-
    Harry swallowed his chocolate, and said in that empty voice, "They're stupid.
    They should die<em>mmmppphhh</em>" as another piece of chocolate entered his
    mouth.
8009:
  text: |-
    Hermione saw the looks of shock that crossed their faces.
8010:
  text: |-
    "He doesn't mean it, does he?" Seamus said it like he was begging.
8011:
  text: |-
    "You don't understand," Hermione said, her voice breaking, "<em>that's not Harry
    -</em>" and she shut up before she said anything more, but she <em>had</em> to
    say that much.
8012:
  text: |-
    She saw from the look on his face that Neville understood, and she also saw that
    the others didn't. If Harry had really never thought anything like that, then
    being exposed to a Dementor for less than a minute wouldn't have made him say
    it. That's what they were probably thinking.
8013:
  text: |-
    Less than a minute of Dementor exposure couldn't create a whole new evil person
    inside you out of nothing.
8014:
  text: |-
    But if that person was <em>already there</em> -
8015:
  text: |-
    <em>Does the Headmaster know?</em>
8016:
  text: |-
    Hermione looked up at the Headmaster, and found that Albus Dumbledore was gazing
    at <em>her</em>, and that his blue eyes had grown suddenly piercing -
8017:
  text: |-
    Words came into her mind.
8018:
  text: |-
    <em>Do not speak of it,</em> said the will of Dumbledore to her.
8019:
  text: |-
    <em>You know,</em> thought Hermione. <em>About his dark side.</em>
8020:
  text: |-
    <em>I know. But this is beyond even that. Fawkes's song cannot reach him, where
    he is lost.</em>
8021:
  text: |-
    <em>What can we -</em>
8022:
  text: |-
    <em>I have a plan,</em> sent the Headmaster. <em>Patience.</em>
8023:
  text: |-
    Something about the tenor of that thought made Hermione nervous. <em>What sort
    of plan?</em>
8024:
  text: |-
    <em>It is better that you not know,</em> sent the Headmaster.
8025:
  text: |-
    Now Hermione was getting <em>really</em> nervous. She didn't know how
    <em>much</em> the Headmaster knew about Harry's dark side -
8026:
  text: |-
    <em>A fair point,</em> sent the Headmaster. <em>I am about to tell you; steel
    yourself so as not to react. Are you ready? Good. I am going to pretend to cast
    the Killing Curse on Professor McGonagall - DO NOT REACT, Hermione!</em>
8027:
  text: |-
    That took work. The Headmaster really was crazy! That wouldn't bring Harry
    <em>out</em> of his dark side, Harry would go <em>completely berserk</em>, he'd
    <em>kill</em> the Headmaster -
8028:
  text: |-
    <em>But that is not true darkness,</em> sent Albus Dumbledore. <em>That is
    protectiveness, that is love. Fawkes will be able to reach him, then. And when
    Harry sees that Minerva is alive after all, it will return him fully.</em>
8029:
  text: |-
    The thought came to Hermione -
8030:
  text: |-
    <em>I doubt that will work,</em> sent the Headmaster, <em>and you may not like
    the way he reacts if you try. But you may try if you wish.</em>
8031:
  text: |-
    She hadn't really meant that seriously! It was too -
8032:
  text: |-
    Then her eyes moved, breaking gaze with the Headmaster, going to the boy looking
    around with empty, despising eyes as his mouth kept chewing and swallowing bar
    after bar of chocolate without effect. Her heart wrenched, and suddenly a lot of
    things didn't seem to matter, only that there was a chance.

8033:
  text: |-
    There was a compulsion to chew and swallow chocolate. The response to compulsion
    was killing.
8034:
  text: |-
    People had gathered around and stared. That was annoying. The response to
    annoyance was killing.
8035:
  text: |-
    Other people were chattering in the background. That was insolent. The response
    to insolence was to inflict pain, but since none of them were useful, killing
    them would be simpler.
8036:
  text: |-
    Killing all those people would be difficult. But many of them didn't trust
    Quirrell, who was strong. Finding exactly the right trigger could cause them all
    to kill each other.
8037:
  text: |-
    Then a person leaned over into the field of vision and did something completely
    strange, something that belonged to a foreign mode of thought, for which there
    was only a single response stored anywhere -

  text: |-
    She heard the gasps around her, and they didn't matter, she maintained the kiss
    on those chocolate-smeared lips as the tears welled in her eyes.
8039:
  text: |-
    And Harry's arms came up and pushed her away, and his lips yelled, "<em>I told
    you, no kissing!</em>â€¯"
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
8040:
  text: |-
    "I think he'll be all right now," the Headmaster said, looking at where Harry
    was crying in great wretched sobs as Fawkes crooned over him. "Excellently done,
    Miss Granger. Do you know, not even I would have expected that to actually
    work?"
8041:
  text: |-
    The phoenix's song wasn't meant for her, Hermione knew, but she could still be
    soothed by it, which she needed, because her life was officially over.
