    <em>The fourth meeting:<br/> (4:38pm, April 17th, 1992)</em>
16560:
  text: |-
    The man wearing the worn, warm coat, with three faint scars etched forever into
    his cheek, observed Harry Potter as closely as he could while the boy looked
    around politely at the rows of cottages. For someone whose best friend had died
    yesterday, Harry Potter seemed strangely composed, though not in any way
    reminiscent of unfeelingness, or normality. <em>I don't wish to talk about
    that,</em> the boy had said, <em>with you or anyone.</em> Saying 'wish' and not
    'want', as though to emphasize that he was able to use grownup words and make
    grownup decisions. There had been only one thing Remus Lupin had thought of that
    might help, after he'd received the owls from Professor McGonagall and that
    strange man Quirinus Quirrell.
16561:
  text: |-
    "There's a lot of empty houses," the boy said, glancing around again.
16562:
  text: |-
    Godric's Hollow had changed, in the decade since Remus Lupin had been a frequent
    visitor. Many of the old, peaked cottages looked deserted, with green leafy
    vines growing across their windows and their doors. Britain had contracted
    noticeably, in the aftermath of the Wizarding War, having lost not only the dead
    but the fled. Godric's Hollow had been hard-hit. And afterward still more
    families had moved elsewhere, to Hogsmeade or magical London, the deserted
    houses too uncomfortable a reminder.
16563:
  text: |-
    Others had remained. Godric's Hollow was older than Hogwarts, older than Godric
    Gryffindor whose name it had taken, and there were families which would reside
    here until the end of the world and its magic.
16564:
  text: |-
    The Potters had been one such family, and would be again, if the last Potter so
    chose.
16565:
  text: |-
    Remus Lupin tried to explain all that, simplifying it as best he could for the
    young boy. The Ravenclaw nodded thoughtfully and said nothing, as though he had
    understood it all without need of questions. Perhaps that was so; the child of
    James Potter and Lily Evans, the Head Boy and Head Girl of Hogwarts, would
    hardly be stupid. The child had certainly seemed highly intelligent, for the
    little time that they had spoken in January, though at that time Remus had done
    most of the talking.
16566:
  text: |-
    (There was also that business with the Wizengamot which Remus had heard rumors
    about, but Remus didn't believe a single word of that, any more than he'd
    believed it about James betrothing his son to Molly's youngest.)
16567:
  text: |-
    "There's the monument," Remus said, pointing ahead of them.

16568:
  text: |-
    Harry walked beside Mr. Lupin toward the black marble obelisk, thinking
    silently. It seemed to Harry that this adventure was essentially misguided; he
    had no use for grief counseling, that was not Harry's chosen path. So far as
    Harry was concerned, the five stages of grief were Rage, Remorse, Resolve,
    Research, and Resurrection. (Not that the usual 'five stages of grief' had any
    experimental evidence whatsoever that Harry had ever heard about.) But Mr. Lupin
    had seemed too sincere to refuse; and visiting James and Lily's home was
    something Harry felt he ought not to turn down. So Harry walked, feeling oddly
    detached; walking silently through a play whose script he was not interested in
    reading.
16569:
  text: |-
    Harry had been told that he wasn't to wear the Cloak of Invisibility for this
    journey, so that Mr. Lupin could keep track of him.
16570:
  text: |-
    Harry was morally certain that Dumbledore, or both Dumbledore and Mad-Eye Moody,
    were following them invisibly to see if anyone tried for the bait. There was no
    way Harry would have been let out of Hogwarts with only Remus Lupin for a guard.
    Harry didn't expect anything to happen, though. He'd seen nothing to contradict
    the hypothesis that all the danger centered on Hogwarts and only Hogwarts.
16571:
  text: |-
    As the two of them walked closer toward the center of town, the marble obelisk
    transformed into -
16572:
  text: |-
    Harry drew in a breath. He'd been expecting a heroic pose of James Potter with
    wand leveled against Lord Voldemort, and Lily Potter with arms outstretched in
    front of the crib.
16573:
  text: |-
    Instead there was a man with untidy hair and glasses, and a woman with her hair
    let down and a baby in her arms, and that was all.
16574:
  text: |-
    "It looks very... normal," Harry said, feeling an odd catch in his throat.
16575:
  text: |-
    "Madam Longbottom and Professor Dumbledore put their foot down hard," said Mr.
    Lupin, who was looking more at Harry than at the monument. "They said that the
    Potters should be remembered as they had lived, not as they had died."
16576:
  text: |-
    Harry looked at the statue, thinking. Very strange, to see himself as a baby of
    stone, with no scar upon his forehead. It was a glimpse at an alternate
    universe, one where Harry James Potter (no Evans-Verres to his name) became an
    intelligent but ordinary wizarding scholar, maybe Sorted into Gryffindor like
    his parents. A Harry Potter who grew up a proper young wizard, knowing little of
    science for all that his mother was Muggleborn. Ultimately changing... not much.
    James and Lily wouldn't have raised their son with what Professor Quirrell would
    have called <em>ambition</em> and what Professor Verres-Evans would have called
    <em>the common endeavor.</em> His birth parents would have loved him very much,
    and that would not have been much help to anyone in the world except Harry. If
    someone had undone their death -
16577:
  text: |-
    "You were their friend," Harry said, turning to look at Lupin. "For a long time,
    since you were children."
16578:
  text: |-
    Mr. Lupin nodded silently.
16579:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell's voice resounded in Harry's approximate memory: <em>The most
    likely difference is not that you care more. Rather it is that, being a more
    logical creature than they, only you are aware that the role of Friend ought to
    require this of you...</em>
16580:
  text: |-
    "When Lily and James died," Harry said, "did you think at all of whether there
    might be some magical way to get them back? Like Orpheus and Eurydice? Or the,
    what was it, Elrin brothers?"
16581:
  text: |-
    "There is no magic which can undo death," Mr. Lupin said quietly. "There are
    some mysteries which wizardry cannot touch."
16582:
  text: |-
    "Did you do a mental check of what you thought you knew, how you thought you
    knew it, and how high the probability was of that conclusion?"
16583:
  text: |-
    "What?" said Mr. Lupin. "Could you repeat that, Harry?"
16584:
  text: |-
    "I'm saying, did you think about it anyway?"
16585:
  text: |-
    Mr. Lupin shook his head.
16586:
  text: |-
    "Why not?"
16587:
  text: |-
    "Because it was already done, and over," Remus Lupin said gently. "Because
    wherever James and Lily are now, they would wish me to act for the sake of the
    living, not the dead."
16588:
  text: |-
    Harry nodded silently. He'd been pretty sure of the answer to that question
    before he'd asked. He'd already read that script. But he'd asked anyway, just in
    case Mr. Lupin had spent a week obsessing about it, because Harry could have
    been wrong.
16589:
  text: |-
    The soft voice of the Defense Professor seemed to speak in Harry's mind.
    <em>Surely, if Lupin truly cared, he would not need special instruction for
    something as simple as thinking for five minutes before giving up...</em>
16590:
  text: |-
    <em>Yes, he would,</em> Harry answered the mental voice. <em>Human beings
    wouldn't suddenly obtain a skill like that just because they cared. I learned
    about it because I'd read library books, produced by a huge scientific edifice
    -</em>
16591:
  text: |-
    And that other part of Harry said, in that soft voice, <em>But there is also
    another hypothesis, Mr. Potter, and it fits the data in a much less complicated
    way.</em>
16592:
  text: |-
    <em>No it doesn't! How would people even know what to pretend, if nobody had
    ever cared?</em>
16593:
  text: |-
    <em>They don't know. That is what you observe.</em>
16594:
  text: |-
    The two of them walked onward toward a certain house, past a long row of
    occupied wizard cottages and other cottages overgrown with vines.
16595:
  text: |-
    Coming finally to the house with half its top blown off, and green leaves
    growing over into the inside; behind a shoulder-high wild-growing hedge lining
    the sidewalk, and a narrow metal gate (Mr. Hagrid had probably stepped right
    over it, being unable to fit through). The gap in the roof was like a giant
    mouth had taken a circular bite from the house, leaving spines of wood, what had
    maybe been support beams, sticking out. To the right side a single chimney still
    stood upright, uneaten by the giant bite, but leaning dangerously without its
    former support. Windows were shattered. Where there should have been a front
    door were only splinters of wood.
16596:
  text: |-
    To this place Lord Voldemort had come, <em>silently, making less noise than the
    dead leaves slithering along the pavement...</em>
16597:
  text: |-
    Remus Lupin put a hand upon Harry's shoulder. "Touch the gate," Mr. Lupin urged.
16598:
  text: |-
    Harry reached out a hand and did so.
16599:
  text: |-
    Like a fast-growing flower a sign burst from the tangled weeds in the ground
    behind the gate, a wooden sign with golden letters, and it said:
16600:
  text: |-
    On this spot, on the night of 31 October 1981,<br/> Lily and James Potter lost
    their lives.
16601:
  text: |-
    They were survived by their son, Harry Potter,<br/> the only wizard ever to
    withstand the Killing Curse,<br/> the Boy-Who-Lived, who broke You-Know-Who's
    power.
16602:
  text: |-
    This house has been left in its ruined state,<br/> as a monument to the
    Potters,<br/> as a reminder of their sacrifice.
16603:
  text: |-
    In a blank space below the golden letters were written other messages, dozens of
    them, magical ink that rose to the surface and gleamed brightly enough to be
    read before fading and giving way to other messages.
16604:
  text: |-
    So my Gideon is avenged.
16605:
  text: |-
    Thank you, Harry Potter. Fare well wherever you are.
16606:
  text: |-
    We will always be in the Potters' debt.
16607:
  text: |-
    Oh James, oh Lily, I am sorry.
16608:
  text: |-
    I hope you're alive, Harry Potter.
16609:
  text: |-
    There is always a price.
16610:
  text: |-
    I wish our last words had been kinder, James. I'm sorry.
16611:
  text: |-
    There is always a dawn after the night.
16612:
  text: |-
    Rest well, Lily.
16613:
  text: |-
    Bless you, Boy-Who-Lived. You were our miracle.
16614:
  text: |-
    "I guess -" Harry said. "I guess that's what people do - instead of trying to
    make it better -" Harry stopped. The thought seemed unworthy of this place. He
    looked up, and saw Remus Lupin gazing at him with a look so gentle that Harry
    wrenched his eyes away to the blasted and broken roof.
16615:
  text: |-
    <em>You were our miracle.</em> Harry had always heard the word 'miracle' in the
    context of how, in the natural universe, there was no such thing. And yet
    looking at the ruined house, he suddenly knew exactly what the word meant, the
    note of grace all unexplained, the blessing inexplicable. The Dark Lord had
    almost won, and then in one night all the darkness and terror had ended,
    salvation without justification, a sudden dawn from out of the darkness and even
    now nobody knew <em>why</em> -
16616:
  text: |-
    If Lily Potter had lived beyond her confrontation with Lord Voldemort, she would
    have felt that way when she saw her baby alive, afterward.
16617:
  text: |-
    "Let's go," whispered the baby boy, ten years later.
16618:
  text: |-
    They went.
16619:
  text: |-
    The graveyard's entrance was guarded by a lockless gate of the sort that kept
    out animals, with a place to stand while you moved the door from one side of the
    standing-place to the other. Remus took out his wand (Harry was already holding
    his) and there was a brief blur as they stepped through.
16620:
  text: |-
    Some of the stones rising up from the ground looked as old as the wall in Oxford
    that his father had said was around a thousand years old.
16621:
  text: |-
    <em>Hallie Fleming,</em> said the first stone that Harry saw, in a carving
    almost invisibly faded with the erosion of time. <em>Vienna Wood,</em> said
    another.
16622:
  text: |-
    It had been a long time since Harry had visited a graveyard. His mind had still
    been childlike the last time he'd come to one, long before he'd seen within
    Death's shadow. Coming here now was... strange, and sad, and puzzling, and
    <em>this has been happening for so long, why haven't wizards tried to stop it,
    why aren't they putting all their strength into that like Muggles do with
    medical research, only more so, wizards have more reason to hope...</em>
16623:
  text: |-
    "The Dumbledores lived in Godric's Hollow too?" Harry said, as they walked past
    a pair of relatively new stones saying <em>Kendra Dumbledore</em> and <em>Ariana
    Dumbledore.</em>
16624:
  text: |-
    "For a long, long time," Mr. Lupin said.
16625:
  text: |-
    They walked further into the graveyard, far toward the end, past many deaths
    that had been mourned.
16626:
  text: |-
    Then Mr. Lupin pointed at a linked double headstone, of marble still white and
    unaged.
16627:
  text: |-
    "Are there going to be messages there?" Harry said. He didn't want to deal any
    more with the way that other people dealt with death.
16628:
  text: |-
    Mr. Lupin shook his head.
16629:
  text: |-
    They walked toward the linked white stones.
16630:
  text: |-
    And stood before -
16631:
  text: |-
    "What is this?" Harry whispered. "Who... <em>who wrote this?</em> "
16632:
  text: |-
    JAMES POTTER<br/> BORN 27 MARCH 1960<br/> DIED 31 OCTOBER 1981
16633:
  text: |-
    "Wrote what?" said Mr. Lupin, puzzled.
16634:
  text: |-
    LILY POTTER<br/> BORN 30 JANUARY 1960<br/> DIED 31 OCTOBER 1981
16635:
  text: |-
    "<em>This!</em> " Harry cried. "The <em>inscription!</em> " There were tears
    welling up in Harry's eyes, at the brightness out of place and unexplained, the
    touch of grace where no grace should have been, the mysterious blessing, tears
    welling up at
16636:
  text: |-
    THE LAST ENEMY THAT SHALL BE DESTROYED IS DEATH
16637:
  text: |-
    "That?" Mr. Lupin said. "That's the... motto, I suppose you could call it, of
    the Potters. Though I don't think it was ever something as formal as that. Just
    a saying handed down from long, long ago..."
16638:
  text: |-
    "This - that -" Harry scrambled down to kneel beside the grave, touched the
    inscription with a trembling hand. "<em>How?</em> Things like that can't just
    be, be <em>genetic</em> -"
16639:
  text: |-
    Then Harry saw what tears had blurred, the faint carving of a line, within a
    circle, within a triangle.
16640:
  text: |-
    The symbol of the Deathly Hallows.
16641:
  text: |-
    And Harry understood.
16642:
  text: |-
    "They tried," Harry whispered.
16643:
  text: |-
    <em>The three Peverell brothers.</em>
16644:
  text: |-
    <em>Had they lost someone precious to them, was that where it had begun?</em>
16645:
  text: |-
    "With all their lives, they tried, and they made progress -"
16646:
  text: |-
    <em>The Cloak of Invisibility, that could defeat the Dementors' sight.</em>
16647:
  text: |-
    "- but their research wasn't finished -"
16648:
  text: |-
    <em>Hiding from Death's shadow is not defeating Death itself. The Resurrection
    Stone couldn't really bring anyone back. The Elder Wand couldn't protect you
    from old age.</em>
16649:
  text: |-
    "- so they passed on the mission to their children, and their children's
    children."
16650:
  text: |-
    <em>Generation after generation.</em>
16651:
  text: |-
    <em>Until it came to me.</em>
16652:
  text: |-
    Could Time echo like that, rhyming, between this far into the future, and that
    far in the past? It <em>couldn't</em> be coincidence, could it? Not this
    message, not in this place.
16653:
  text: |-
    <em>My family.</em>
16654:
  text: |-
    <em>You really were, my mother and my father.</em>
16655:
  text: |-
    "It doesn't mean resurrecting the dead, Harry," Mr. Lupin said. "It means
    accepting death, and so being beyond death, mastering it."
16656:
  text: |-
    "Did James tell you that?" Harry said, his voice strange.
16657:
  text: |-
    "No," said Mr. Lupin, "but -"
16658:
  text: |-
    "Good."
16659:
  text: |-
    Harry rose up slowly from where he had been kneeling, feeling as though he were
    pushing up a sun upon his shoulders, raising the dawn above the
    horizon.<em><br/></em>
16660:
  text: |-
    <em>Of</em> course <em>other wizards have tried. I am not unique. I was never
    alone. These feelings in my heart, they're not so special, not in the wizard
    world or the Muggle one.</em>
16661:
  text: |-
    "Harry, your wand!" There was a sudden excitement in Mr. Lupin's voice, and when
    Harry raised his wand to look at it closely, he saw that it was gleaming ever so
    faintly with a silver light, welling out of the wood.
16662:
  text: |-
    "Cast the Patronus Charm!" urged Mr. Lupin. "Try casting it again, Harry!"
16663:
  text: |-
    <em>Oh, right. So far as Mr. Lupin knows, I can't -</em>
16664:
  text: |-
    Harry smiled, and even laughed a little. "I'd better not," Harry said. "If I
    tried to cast the spell in this state of mind, it'd probably kill me."
16665:
  text: |-
    <em>"What?</em> " said Mr. Lupin. "The Patronus Charm doesn't do that!"
16666:
  text: |-
    Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres raised his left hand, still laughing, and wiped
    away some more tears.
16667:
  text: |-
    "You know, Mr. Lupin," Harry said, "it really takes a <em>baroque</em>
    interpretation to think that somebody would be walking around, pondering how
    death is just something we all have to accept, and communicate their state of
    mind by saying, 'The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.' Maybe someone
    else thought it sounded poetic and picked up the phrase and tried to interpret
    it differently, but whoever said it first didn't like death much." Sometimes it
    puzzled Harry how most people didn't seem to even <em>notice</em> when they were
    twisting something around to the 180-degree opposite of its first obvious
    reading. It couldn't be a raw brainpower thing, people could see the obvious
    reading of most other English sentences. "Also 'shall be destroyed' refers to a
    change of future state, so it can't be about the way things are now."
16668:
  text: |-
    Remus Lupin was staring at him with wide eyes. "You certainly are James and
    Lily's child," the man said, sounding rather shocked.
16669:
  text: |-
    "Yes, I am," Harry said. But that wasn't enough, he had to do something more, so
    Harry raised his wand in the air and said, his voice as steady as he could make
    it, "I am Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, the son of Lily and James, of the
    house of Potter, and I accept my family's quest. Death is my enemy, and I will
    defeat it."
16670:
  text: |-
    <em>Thrayen beyn Peverlas soona ahnd thrih heera toal thissoom Dath bey
    yewoonen.</em>
16671:
  text: |-
    "What?" Harry said aloud. The words had popped up into his stream of
    consciousness as though from his own thoughts, unexplained.
16672:
  text: |-
    "What was that?" said Remus Lupin at the same time.
16673:
  text: |-
    Harry turned, scanning the graveyard, but he didn't see anything. Beside him,
    Mr. Lupin was doing the same.
16674:
  text: |-
    Neither of them noticed the tall stone worn as though from a thousand years of
    age, upon it a line within a circle within a triangle glowing ever so faintly
    silver, like the light which had shone from Harry's wand, invisible at that
    distance beneath the still-bright Sun.

    <em>Some time later:</em>
16676:
  text: |-
    "Thank you again, Mr. Lupin," Harry said, the tall, faintly scarred man was
    about to depart once more. "Though I really wish you hadn't -"
16677:
  text: |-
    "Professor Dumbledore said that I was to portkey us back to Hogwarts if anything
    unusual happened, whether or not it seemed like an attack," Mr. Lupin said
    firmly. "Which is eminently sensible."
16678:
  text: |-
    Harry nodded. And then, having carefully saved this question for last, "Do you
    have any idea of what the words meant?"
16679:
  text: |-
    "If I did, I wouldn't tell you," Mr. Lupin said, looking rather severe.
    "Certainly not without Professor Dumbledore's permission. I can understand your
    eagerness, but you should not go trying to uncover any ancestral secrets of the
    Potters until you are an adult. That means after you've passed your NEWTs,
    Harry, or at least your OWLs. And I still think you've picked up entirely the
    wrong idea of what your family motto is meant to say!"
16680:
  text: |-
    Harry nodded, sighing internally, and bid Mr. Lupin farewell.

  text: |-
    Harry went back through Hogwarts, to the Ravenclaw Tower, feeling strange, and
    strengthened. He would not have expected any of that, but it had been all to the
    good.
16682:
  text: |-
    He was passing through the Ravenclaw common room, on the way to his dorm.
16683:
  text: |-
    That was when the shining creature came to him, gleaming soft white beneath the
    candlefires of the Ravenclaw common room, as it slithered out from nowhere, the
    silver snake.

    on the outskirts of what would later be called Godric's Hollow.
