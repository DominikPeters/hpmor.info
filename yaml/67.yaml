    In the high reaches of Hogwarts where rooms and corridors changed on a daily
    basis, where the territory itself was uncertain and not just the map, where the
    stability of the castle began to fray into dreams and chaos without changing its
    architectural style or apparent solidity - in the high reaches of Hogwarts, a
    battle would soon be fought.
11546:
  text: |-
    The presence of so many students would stabilize the corridors for a time, by
    dint of constant observation. The rooms and corridors of Hogwarts sometimes
    <em>moved</em> even while people looked directly at them, but they wouldn't
    <em>change</em>. Even after eight centuries, Hogwarts was still a little shy
    about changing in front of people.
11547:
  text: |-
    But despite that transient permanence (the Defense Professor had said) the upper
    reaches of Hogwarts still had a military realism: you had to learn the ground
    anew each time, and check every closet for secret corridors all over again.
11548:
  text: |-
    Sunday it was, Sunday the first of March. Professor Quirrell had recovered
    enough to supervise battles once more, and they were all catching up on the
    backlog.
11549:
  text: |-
    The Dragon General, Draco Malfoy, watched two compasses he held in either hand.
    One compass was the color of the Sun, the other had a multicolored, iridescent
    sheen to indicate Chaos. The other two generals, Draco knew, had been given
    their own compasses; only Hermione Granger's hand, and Harry Potter's hand,
    would hold a compass that was orange-red and flickered in its reflections like
    fire, pointing always to the direction of the largest active contingent of
    Dragon Army.
11550:
  text: |-
    Without those compasses they might have searched for days and never found each
    other, which was a territorial hazard of fighting in the upper levels of
    Hogwarts.
11551:
  text: |-
    Draco had a bad feeling about what would happen when Dragon Army found the Chaos
    Legion. Harry Potter had changed since Bellatrix Black had escaped; the Heir of
    Slytherin had begun to seem truly Lordly now (and how had Professor Quirrell
    known that would happen?) Draco would have felt a lot better with Hermione
    Granger standing alongside him with her twenty-three Sunshine Soldiers in tow,
    but no, the Sunshine General was being stupidly proud and refusing to accept aid
    against General Potter. She wanted to take down Potter herself, she'd told him.
11552:
  text: |-
    The Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy had maintained their influence over
    Britain for centuries by understanding that you couldn't always be <em>the</em>
    most powerful. Sometimes another Lord was just stronger, and you had to settle
    for <em>merely</em> being his foremost lieutenant. You could build up
    <em>quite</em> a position of wealth and power over a dozen generations of being
    second in command. You just had to be careful, each time, not to let your House
    be dragged down with the fall of the Lord you served. That was the Malfoy
    tradition which centuries of experience had honed...
11553:
  text: |-
    And so Father had thoroughly explained to Draco that if he ran into someone who
    was obviously stronger than him, Draco was <em>not</em> to resent this and
    <em>not</em> to deny it and <em>not</em> to throw a tantrum that could sabotage
    his potential position, but Draco <em>was</em> to make sure that his place in
    the next generation's power structure wasn't any lower than second.
11554:
  text: |-
    Granger, apparently, had never gotten this lecture from her own parents, and was
    still in denial about the obvious fact that Harry Potter was becoming stronger
    than her.
11555:
  text: |-
    So Draco had secretly met with Captain Goldstein and Captain Bones and Captain
    Macmillan and they'd agreed to all do their best to make sure that Dragon and
    Sunshine didn't engage each other before they engaged the larger threat of
    Chaos.
11556:
  text: |-
    It wasn't <em>really</em> violating the agreement against traitors, you weren't
    soliciting traitors if you honestly meant to <em>help</em> the other army.
11557:
  text: |-
    A high ringing tone belled through the corridors to signal the start of the
    battle, and a moment later Draco shouted "<em>Go!</em> " and the Dragons started
    running. It would tire his soldiers, it would cost them something even after
    they stopped and caught their breath, but they <em>had</em> to put Chaos
    directly between themselves and the Sunshine Regiment.

11558:
  text: |-
    Harry and Neville walked at a leisurely pace through the corridors, Harry
    watching the yellow-golden compass that pointed toward the location of the
    Sunshine Regiment, and Neville keeping a lookout just in case they ran into
    someone else.
11559:
  text: |-
    Their footsteps sounded a bit thumpy, if you listened closely.
11560:
  text: |-
    "So," the Chaotic Lieutenant said after a while. "That's why you had us practice
    dueling with all that weight strapped on?"
11561:
  text: |-
    Harry nodded, keeping his eyes on the compass that led to Sunshine; if the
    apparent direction started to change quickly then they were getting close.
11562:
  text: |-
    "I didn't want to say anything in front of the others, but a couple of weeks
    isn't a lot of time to put on extra muscle," said Neville. "And the balance is
    different, and I think this weighs <em>more</em> actually, and doesn't this
    count as Transfiguring a Muggle artifact?"
11563:
  text: |-
    "Nope," Harry said. "I checked that in advance. You can see it in Hogwarts
    statues, so some wizards <em>used</em> to wear it, even if they were just being
    fashionable for the Dark Ages." And since nobody would ever try this if they
    <em>weren't</em> fighting first-year students using weak spells like the Sleep
    Hex, it didn't count as giving away good ideas, either.
11564:
  text: |-
    They came to a Y-intersection, an annoying one; neither corridor bent in quite
    the right way to take them on a direct intercept course toward where Sunshine
    would go as they followed the Chaos Legion following Dragon Army. So Harry chose
    what seemed like the better of the two options, and Neville followed.
11565:
  text: |-
    "We'd better try a quick Silencing Charm on this stuff when we get close,"
    Neville said. "It's kind of noisy, they might figure it out."
11566:
  text: |-
    Harry nodded, and then said "Good idea" in case Neville hadn't been looking at
    him.
11567:
  text: |-
    They trudged on through the stone-floored corridor of the upper reach of
    Hogwarts, lit by windows of plain glass or stained glass, now and then passing
    statues of witches and dragons and even the occasional wizard-knight in plate
    armor or chainmail.
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
11568:
  text: |-
    The Sunshine Soldiers were striding through a long, wide corridor with their
    wands out and pointed. They couldn't use the Prismatic Shield while they were
    maneuvering, but Parvati Patil and Jenny Rustad were currently maintaining
    <em>Contegos</em> around the officer group, who would be the first targets of
    any ambush.
11569:
  text: |-
    Their tactic for the next battle, she and her officers had decided, would be to
    mix directly in with the enemy soldiers as fast as possible - after having
    practiced among <em>themselves</em> how to support one another, avoid hitting
    each other, and get into positions where enemy soldiers would hesitate to fire.
    They'd only gotten in four hours practice, but she thought her troops would
    already be better at that kind of mixed-in fighting than soldiers who hadn't
    practiced at all. It seemed like the sort of tactic Chaos would use, but they
    hadn't actually used it yet.
11570:
  text: |-
    It was a good strategy, she believed. And yet still, no matter how much she'd
    lectured her soldiers, they'd persisted in whispering fearful rumors about what
    Harry and Neville were learning to do. Finally she'd gone off and talked with
    Captain Goldstein, who understood things like Troop Morale, and Anthony had
    suggested -
11571:
  text: |-
    "That's weird," Captain Macmillan spoke up suddenly, frowning at the fiery and
    iridescent compasses he held in either hand. (Ernie was, as Harry would have
    termed it, "good at spatial visualization", and so had been designated to hold
    both compasses and try to figure out what their enemies were doing.) "I think...
    Dragon's not moving fast anymore... I think they got on the other side of Chaos
    from us first... and it looks like Chaos is moving to attack them instead of
    trying to maneuver out from in between?"
11572:
  text: |-
    Hermione frowned, trying to understand, and she saw similar frowns on the faces
    of Anthony and Ron. If Chaos and Dragon attacked each other straight out, and
    spent all their forces fighting each other, that was practically conceding the
    battle to Sunshine...
11573:
  text: |-
    "Potter thinks we're allied so he's attacking Malfoy now, before Dragon can link
    up with us," said Blaise Zabini from the common ranks of soldiers. "Or Potter
    just thinks he can beat both armies in a row, if he attacks them separately."
    The Slytherin boy gave a condescending sigh. "Are you going to promote me back
    to officer now? You lot are hopeless without me, you know."
11574:
  text: |-
    They all ignored the talking noises coming from Zabini's mouth.
11575:
  text: |-
    "We still moving in the right direction?" said Anthony.
11576:
  text: |-
    "Yeah," said Ernie.
11577:
  text: |-
    "We getting close to them?" said Ron.
11578:
  text: |-
    "Not yet -"
11579:
  text: |-
    That was when the huge black-wooden doors at the end of the corridor flew open
    and crashed into the wall, revealing two figures almost completely enveloped in
    grey cloaks, grey cloth stretched over the faces beneath the grey hoods, one of
    those figures already raising a wand and pointing it directly at her.
11580:
  text: |-
    And then the face of the game changed drastically, as Harry's voice, high and
    strained with the effort, screamed the word:
11581:
  text: |-
    "<em>Stupefy!</em> "
11582:
  text: |-
    The dueling-grade stunner blasted toward her, she was so shocked that she didn't
    start to move until almost too late, as the red jet of light <em>smashed</em>
    right through the <em>Contego</em> shield to their front and she just barely
    dodged, there was a tingle on her arm as the red light went past her, and she
    saw out of the corner of her eye Susan getting hit and blown off her feet into
    Ron -
11583:
  text: |-
    "<em>Somnium!</em> " bellowed Anthony's voice, followed a moment later by a
    dozen voices crying "<em>Somnium!</em> "
11584:
  text: |-
    Hermione frantically pushed herself to her feet, and as she rose, she saw the
    two figures in the grey cloaks just standing there.
11585:
  text: |-
    You couldn't <em>see</em> Sleep Hexes, the spell was too weak -
11586:
  text: |-
    But there was no way they all could've <em>missed</em>.
11587:
  text: |-
    "<em>Stupefy!</em> " shrieked the voice of Neville Longbottom, and another red
    jet shot at her, she fell in an undignified heap as she desperately twisted out
    of the way, and when she scrambled up, panting, she saw that this time the
    stunbolt had gotten Ron where he'd been rising from the ground.
11588:
  text: |-
    "Hello there, Sunshine," said Harry's voice from beneath his hood.
11589:
  text: |-
    "We're the Grey Knights of Chaos," said Neville's voice.
11590:
  text: |-
    "We'll be your opponents for this battle," said Harry's voice, "while Chaos's
    <em>other</em> army slaughters the Dragons."
11591:
  text: |-
    "And by the way," said Neville's voice, "we're invincible."
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
11592:
  text: |-
    The two boys in their grey cloaks and robes, grey cloth over their faces, stood
    facing Sunshine's entire army, seemingly unfazed by a dozen Sleep Hexes.
11593:
  text: |-
    Daphne heard a soft sigh from beside her, and when her head turned she saw that
    Hannah's lips were parted, and the Hufflepuff girl's eyes were huge, and she was
    staring at -
11594:
  text: |-
    It would have been hard to describe the jumble of thoughts that flashed through
    Daphne's mind as she realized that Hannah was staring at Neville rather than
    Harry, which in turn seemed to trigger some part of her into noticing that in
    point of fact Neville <em>had</em> been getting pretty interesting lately as
    boys went, in fact right now the Last Scion of Longbottom was seeming downright
    <em>cool,</em> and something woke up inside her and her own lips parted and
    everything the Lady her Mother had ever instructed her about demure demeanors
    and flattery and scented shampoo blew straight out of her mind so hard it should
    have fluffed her hair about her ears, because she'd watched Hermione and Harry
    and she knew how she wanted <em>her</em> own courtship to go -
11595:
  text: |-
    Her Lady Mother had also recently instructed her on a few spells it might be
    embarrassing not to know if you belonged to the Noble and Most Ancient House of
    Greengrass.
11596:
  text: |-
    Daphne's wand swung to point to her left, and she shouted "<em>Tonare!</em> "

    The wand went over her head, and she spoke the incantation "<em>Ravum

    And finally she grasped her wand in both hands and shrieked, "<em>Lucis

        "Tonare!" is "Thunder!" from Thundercats. "Lucis Gladius" is "Sword of Light"
        from Slayers, not just "Light Saber". I mean, what were the odds that only the
        first word was <em>not</em> a reference?

    The huge magical drain almost sent her to her knees, but she bore it, and when
    the blazing shape had fully formed and stabilized the drain was a little less.
11600:
  text: |-
    Still, she had a feeling she'd better not try to fight with this for long.
11601:
  text: |-
    That everyone was staring at her went <em>quite</em> without saying, and she
    <em>should</em> have leaped forward to confront Neville with her hair billowing
    around her, but it was all she could do to walk forward steadily to level her
    Most Ancient Blade at Neville Longbottom. That everyone moved aside and made way
    for her also went without saying.
11602:
  text: |-
    "<em>I hight Daphne, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Greengrass!</em> "
    she cried. "<em>Greengrass of Sunshine!</em> " The dueling forms had gone
    completely out of her mind, she'd seen enough plays to remember death challenges
    and blood challenges but she couldn't remember at all what was appropriate for
    this, so she just pointed the incandescent sword toward the object of her crush
    and yelled, "<em>Let's see what you got, Nevvy!</em> "
11603:
  text: |-
    Once again Harry's voice shrieked "<em>Stupefy!</em> ", and later on, when she
    was remembering this, she could never quite believe she'd managed to do it, but
    she slashed out with her blade of light like it was a Beater's bat, and <em>hit
    the stunbolt back at Harry</em> who just barely managed to twist out of the way.
11604:
  text: |-
    "<em>Tonare!</em> " shouted Neville, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of
    Longbottom. "<em>Ravum Calvaria, Lucis Gladius!</em> "
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
11605:
  text: |-
    For a few seconds, no one did anything but stare at Neville and Daphne as they
    started whacking at each other. They were both moving slowly, and Hermione
    guessed that the spell was taking a lot of strength out of them. It wasn't very
    impressive by comparison, if you were a Muggleborn and you'd watched certain
    movies.
11606:
  text: |-
    But you still had to give them extra credit for using lightsabers at all.
11607:
  text: |-
    "Point of order," said Harry's voice. "I know the Defense Professor is watching,
    but I still have to ask, does anyone know whether they'll slice each other in
    half if they actually hit -"
11608:
  text: |-
    "No," Hermione said absently. This had been in one of her history books, though
    she'd had no idea the magical dueling sword looked like <em>that</em>. "They
    cast it so it'll only stun if it touches."
11609:
  text: |-
    "You <em>know</em> that spell?"
11610:
  text: |-
    "Oh, no, it's the Charm of the Most Ancient Blade, it's only legal for Noble and
    Most Ancient Houses to use -"
11611:
  text: |-
    Hermione stopped talking and looked at Harry, or Harry's grey hood rather.
11612:
  text: |-
    "Well," said Harry's voice, "I guess I could take down the rest of the Sunshine
    Regiment by myself, then." She couldn't see his face, but his voice sounded like
    he was smiling.
11613:
  text: |-
    "You dodged when Daphne hit your own spell back at you," Hermione said. "So
    whatever you did, you're <em>not</em> invincible. A <em>Stupefy</em> can still
    get you."
11614:
  text: |-
    "Interesting theory," said Harry's voice from beneath the hood. "Got anyone in
    your army who can test it?"
11615:
  text: |-
    "I read about the Stunning Hex once," said Hermione. "A few months ago. I wonder
    if I can remember the instructions right?" Her wand came up to point at Harry.
11616:
  text: |-
    There was a slight pause, as nearby a boy and a girl breathing in audible gasps
    slowly whacked at each other with lightsabers.
11617:
  text: |-
    "Of course," Harry said, leveling his own wand on her, "<em>I</em> can just use
    Somnium on you. That'll take a lot less effort."
11618:
  text: |-
    New <em>Contego</em> shields sprung into existence in front of her, cast by
    Jenny and Parvati, even as Harry spoke.
11619:
  text: |-
    The tip of Hermione's own wand began making small motions in the air, a diamond
    within a circle, a diamond within a circle, rehearsing the gesture to match
    exactly what she remembered seeing in the book. It would be a difficult feat
    even for her, but she <em>had</em> to cast the spell right on the first try, she
    couldn't afford any failed castings that would sap her energy.
11620:
  text: |-
    "You know," said Hermione Granger, "I understand that it's not really your
    fault, but I'm getting tired of hearing people talk about the Boy-Who-Lived like
    you're - like you're some kind of <em>god</em> or something."
11621:
  text: |-
    "Same here, I must say," said Harry Potter. "It's sad how people keep
    underestimating me."
11622:
  text: |-
    Her wand kept rehearsing the diamond within the circle, over and over. Harry
    would be recharging his own strength, she knew, even as she practiced as much as
    she could before her attack. "I'm starting to think you need taking down a peg,
    General Chaos."
11623:
  text: |-
    "You could be right," Harry said equably. His feet began to shuffle through what
    she recognized as a duelist's dance. "Unfortunately there's nothing left that
    can defeat me now except another Harry Potter."
11624:
  text: |-
    "Let me be specific, Mr. Potter. <em>I'm</em> taking you down a peg."
11625:
  text: |-
    "You and what other army?"
11626:
  text: |-
    "You think you're pretty cool, don't you," said Hermione.
11627:
  text: |-
    "Why, yes," said Harry. "Yes, I do. Some might call that arrogant, but am I
    supposed to be the last person in Hogwarts to notice how awesome I am?"
11628:
  text: |-
    Hermione raised her left hand into the air, and made a fist.
11629:
  text: |-
    It was a signal. Eight designated soldiers in her army would be pointing their
    wands at her, and quietly casting <em>Wingardium Leviosa</em>.
11630:
  text: |-
    They'd practiced <em>this,</em> too, once Hermione had given up on lecturing her
    soldiers, and at Anthony's suggestion, tried giving them a Sunshine General who
    <em>looked</em> like she could defeat invincible enemies.
11631:
  text: |-
    "You pretend you're Superman," said Hermione. She raised her left fist higher in
    the air, and the eight soldiers supporting her Hovered her off the ground.
    "<em>Well here's Super Hermione!</em> " Her hand pushed forward, and as she shot
    rapidly through the air toward Harry, regretting only that she couldn't see the
    look on his face, her wand made a diamond within a circle and she summoned up
    all the magic she could, it felt like she imagined touching a live wire would
    feel as the too-powerful spell poured through her when her voice screamed
    "<em>Stupefy!</em> "
11632:
  text: |-
    The red bolt burst from her wand, perfectly formed.
11633:
  text: |-
    Harry dodged it.
11634:
  text: |-
    And then, because they hadn't practiced doing this part inside of hallways, she
    crashed into a wall.
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
11635:
  text: |-
    "<em>Somnium!</em> " shrieked Draco, and then after only a few seconds to
    recharge, "<em>SOMNIUM, CURSE YOU!</em> "
11636:
  text: |-
    He <em>knew</em> he was hitting Theodore, the other boy wasn't even trying to
    dodge, but the scion of Nott only grinned as evilly as his father and leveled
    his wand -
11637:
  text: |-
    Draco managed to leap aside just as Theodore said "<em>Somnium!</em> " but Draco
    was getting winded, he couldn't keep this up, Theodore wasn't bothering to dodge
    at all while Draco had to keep moving, this was <em>crazy.</em>
11638:
  text: |-
    He had enough strength now to fire again, but -
11639:
  text: |-
    <em>Stupidity is doing the same thing and expecting a different result,</em>
    Harry had said, this was <em>Harry's</em> work somehow, it couldn't be a Muggle
    artifact anymore but Draco couldn't figure out what it <em>could</em> be, and he
    should be thinking of hypotheses and ways to test them but he was too busy
    frantically dodging as Theodore laughed and shot another Sleep Hex at him, Draco
    felt a little numbness in his side that time as he twisted, that had been a very
    very near miss and finally Draco couldn't take it anymore, he didn't bother
    working out what theory he was testing or why as he just -
11640:
  text: |-
    "<em>Luminos!</em> " shouted Draco, and Theodore was haloed in red light,
    "<em>Dulak!</em> " and it went out again (so Theodore <em>was</em> still being
    affected by magic), "<em>Expelliarmus!</em> " and Theodore's wand went flying
    (that had been a good spell to cast anyway now that Draco realized it) but
    Theodore was rushing toward Draco with his arms outstretched to grapple so Draco
    yelled "<em>Flipendo!</em> " and the other boy's feet were abruptly yanked up -
11641:
  text: |-
    - and Theodore's back hit the ground with a surprisingly loud and
    <em>metallic</em>-sounding crash.
11642:
  text: |-
    Draco's vision was swimming now from casting four spells in such fast
    succession, and Theodore was already scrambling to his feet, so there wasn't
    even time to think in words, but Draco still managed to say "<em>Somnium!</em> "
    and <em>this</em> time he aimed for Theodore's face instead of the chest.
11643:
  text: |-
    Theodore dodged (he <em>dodged!</em>) and the boy shouted "<em>Code seven on
    Malfoy!</em> "
11644:
  text: |-
    "<em>Prismatis!</em> " cried Padma's voice and there was suddenly a shimmering
    rainbow wall in front of Draco, just as four Chaotic voices cried
    "<em>Somnium!</em> "
11645:
  text: |-
    And there was a pause, as everyone looked at the huge Prismatic Sphere
    protecting the remnants of Dragon Army.
11646:
  text: |-
    Casting that fifth spell had sent Draco to his hands and knees, but he looked up
    and managed to say, as clearly as he could, "If the Sleep Hex - doesn't work -
    aim for the face - I think the Lieutenants are wearing metal shirts."
