    Draco had a stern expression on his face, and his green-trimmed robes somehow
    looked far more formal, serious, and well-turned-out than the same exact robes
    as worn by the two boys behind him.
3237:
  text: |-
    "Talk," said Draco.
3238:
  text: |-
    "Yeah! Talk!"
3239:
  text: |-
    "You heard da boss! Talk!"
3240:

    "You two, on the other hand, <em>shut up.</em>"

    The last session of classes on Friday was about to start, in that vast
    auditorium where all four Houses learned Defense, er, Battle Magic.

    The last session of classes on Friday.
3243:
  text: |-
    Harry was hoping that this class would be non-stressful, and that the brilliant
    Professor Quirrell would realize this was perhaps not the best time to single
    out Harry for anything. Harry had recovered a little, but...
3244:
  text: |-
    ...but just in case, it was probably best to get in a bit of stress relief
    first.
3245:
  text: |-
    Harry leaned back in his chair and bestowed a look of great solemnity upon Draco
    and his minions.
3246:
  text: |-
    "You ask, what is our aim?" Harry declaimed. "I can answer in one word. It is
    victory. Victory at all costs - Victory in spite of all terrors - Victory,
    however long and hard the road may be, for without victory there is no -"
3247:
  text: |-
    "<em>Talk about Snape,</em>" Draco hissed. "<em>What did you do?</em> "
3248:
  text: |-
    Harry wiped away the fake solemnity and gave Draco a more serious look.
3249:
  text: |-
    "You saw it," Harry said. "Everyone saw it. I snapped my fingers."
3250:
  text: |-
    "<em>Harry! Stop teasing me!</em> "
3251:
  text: |-
    So he'd been promoted to <em>Harry</em> now. Interesting. And in fact Harry was
    fairly sure that he was meant to notice that, and feel bad if he didn't respond
    somehow...
3252:
  text: |-
    Harry tapped his ears and gave a significant glance at the minions.
3253:
  text: |-
    "They won't talk," said Draco.
3254:
  text: |-
    "Draco," Harry said, "I'm going to be one hundred percent honest here and say
    that yesterday I was not particularly impressed with Mr. Goyle's cunning."
3255:
  text: |-
    Mr. Goyle winced.
3256:
  text: |-
    "Me neither," said Draco. "I explained to him that I ended up owing you a favor
    because of it." (Mr. Goyle winced again.) "But there <em>is</em> a big
    difference between that sort of mistake and being indiscreet. That really is
    something they've been trained from childhood to understand."
3257:
  text: |-
    "All right then," Harry said. He lowered his voice, even though the background
    noises had gone to blurs in Draco's presence. "I deduced one of Severus's
    secrets and did a bit of blackmail."
3258:
  text: |-
    Draco's expression hardened. "Good, now tell me something you didn't tell in
    strict confidence to the idiots in Gryffindor, meaning that was the story you
    <em>wanted</em> to get all over the school."
3259:
  text: |-
    Harry grinned involuntarily and he knew that Draco had caught it.
3260:
  text: |-
    "What is Severus saying?" Harry said.
3261:
  text: |-
    "That he hadn't realized how sensitive the feelings of young children were,"
    Draco said. "Even in Slytherin! Even to <em>me!</em> "
3262:
  text: |-
    "Are you sure," Harry said, "that you want to know something your Head of House
    would rather you not know?"
3263:
  text: |-
    "Yes," Draco said without hesitation.
3264:
  text: |-
    <em>Interesting.</em> "Then you really are going to send your minions away
    first, because I'm not sure I can believe everything you believe about them."
3265:
  text: |-
    Draco nodded. "Okay."
3266:
  text: |-
    Mr. Crabbe and Mr. Goyle looked <em>very</em> unhappy. "Boss -" said Mr. Crabbe.
3267:
  text: |-
    "You've given Mr. Potter no reason to trust you," Draco said. "Go!"
3268:
  text: |-
    They left.
3269:
  text: |-
    "In particular," Harry said, lowering his voice even further, "I'm not
    <em>entirely</em> sure that they wouldn't just report what I said to Lucius."
3270:
  text: |-
    "Father wouldn't <em>do</em> that!" Draco said, looking genuinely aghast.
    "They're <em>mine!</em> "
3271:
  text: |-
    "I'm sorry, Draco," Harry said. "I'm just not sure I can believe everything you
    believe about your father. Imagine it was your secret and me telling you my
    father wouldn't do that."
3272:
  text: |-
    Draco nodded slowly. "You're right. <em>I'm</em> sorry, Harry. It was wrong of
    me to ask it of you."
3273:
  text: |-
    <em>How did I get</em> this <em>promoted? Shouldn't he hate me now?</em> Harry
    had the feeling he was looking at something exploitable... he just wished his
    brain wasn't so exhausted. Ordinarily he would have loved to try his hand at
    some complicated plotting.
3274:
  text: |-
    "Anyway," Harry said. "Trade. I tell you a fact that isn't on the grapevine, and
    does not <em>go</em> on the grapevine, and in <em>particular</em> does not go to
    your father, and in return you tell me what you and Slytherin think about the
    whole business."
3275:
  text: |-
    "Deal!"
3276:
  text: |-
    Now to make this as vague as possible... something that wouldn't hurt much even
    if it did get out... "What I said was true. I did discover one of Severus's
    secrets, and I did do some blackmail. But Severus wasn't the only person
    involved."
3277:
  text: |-
    "<em>I knew it!</em> " Draco said exultantly.
3278:
  text: |-
    Harry's stomach sank. He had apparently said something very significant and he
    did not know why. This was not a good sign.
3279:
  text: |-
    "All right," Draco said. He was grinning widely now. "So here's what the
    reaction was like in Slytherin. First, all the idiots were like, 'We hate Harry
    Potter! Let's go beat him up!'"
3280:
  text: |-
    Harry choked. "What is <em>wrong</em> with the Sorting Hat? That's not
    Slytherin, it's <em>Gryffindor</em> -"
3281:
  text: |-
    "Not all children are prodigies," Draco said, though he was smiling in a sort of
    nasty-conspiratorial way, as though to suggest that he privately agreed with
    Harry's opinion. "And it took around fifteen seconds for someone to explain to
    them why this might not be such a favor to Snape, so you're fine. Anyway, after
    that was the second wave of idiots, the ones who were saying, 'Looks like Harry
    Potter was just another do-gooder after all.'"
3282:
  text: |-
    "And then?" Harry said, smiling even though he had no idea why <em>that</em> was
    stupid.
3283:
  text: |-
    "And then the actual smart people started talking. It's obvious that you found a
    way to put a <em>lot</em> of pressure on Snape. And while that could be more
    than one thing... the obvious <em>next</em> thought is that it has something to
    do with Snape's unknown hold over Dumbledore. Am I right?"
3284:
  text: |-
    "No comment," Harry said. At least his brain was processing this part correctly.
    House Slytherin <em>had</em> wondered why Severus wasn't getting fired. And
    they'd concluded that Severus was blackmailing Dumbledore. Could that actually
    be true...? But Dumbledore hadn't seemed to act like it...
3285:
  text: |-
    Draco went on talking. "And the <em>next</em> thing the smart people pointed out
    was that if you could put enough pressure on Snape to make him leave half of
    Hogwarts alone, that meant you probably had enough power to get rid of him
    entirely, if you wanted. What you did to him was a humiliation, just the same
    way he tried to humiliate you - but you left us our Head of House."
3286:
  text: |-
    Harry made his smile wider.
3287:
  text: |-
    "And then the <em>really</em> smart people," Draco said, his face now serious,
    "went off and had a little discussion by themselves, and someone pointed out
    that it would be a very stupid thing to leave an enemy around like that. If you
    could break his hold over Dumbledore, the obvious thing would be to just do it.
    Dumbledore would kick Snape out of Hogwarts and maybe even have him killed, he'd
    be <em>very</em> grateful to you, and you wouldn't have to worry about Snape
    sneaking into your dorm room at night with interesting potions."
3288:
  text: |-
    Harry's face was now neutral. He had not thought of that and he really, really
    should have. "And from this you concluded...?"
3289:
  text: |-
    "Snape's hold was some secret of Dumbledore's and <em>you've got the
    secret!</em> " Draco was looking exultant. "It can't be powerful enough to
    destroy Dumbledore entirely, or Snape would have used it by now. Snape refuses
    to use his hold for anything except staying king of Slytherin House in Hogwarts,
    and he doesn't always get what he wants even then, so it must have limits. But
    it's <em>got</em> to be really good! Father's been trying to get Snape to tell
    him for <em>years!</em> "
3290:
  text: |-
    "And," Harry said, "now Lucius thinks maybe <em>I</em> can tell him. Did you
    already get an owl -"
3291:
  text: |-
    "I will tonight," Draco said, and laughed. "It will say," his voice took on a
    different, more formal cadence, "<em>My beloved son: I've already told you of
    Harry Potter's potential importance. As you have already realized, his
    importance has now become greater and more urgent. If you see any possible
    avenue of friendship or point of pressure with him, you must pursue it, and the
    full resources of Malfoy are at your disposal if needed.</em>"
3292:
  text: |-
    Gosh. "Well," Harry said, "not commenting on whether or not your whole
    complicated edifice of theory is true, let me just say that we are not quite
    such good friends as yet."
3293:
  text: |-
    "I know," Draco said. Then his face turned <em>very</em> serious, and his voice
    grew quiet even within the blur. "Harry, has it occurred to you that if you know
    something Dumbledore doesn't want known, Dumbledore might simply have you
    killed? And it would turn the Boy-Who-Lived from a potential competing leader
    into a valuable martyr, too."
3294:
  text: |-
    "No comment," Harry said yet again. He hadn't thought of that last part, either.
    Didn't <em>seem</em> to be Dumbledore's style... but...
3295:
  text: |-
    "Harry," Draco said, "you've obviously got <em>incredible</em> talent, but
    you've got no training and no mentors and you do stupid things sometimes and
    <em>you really need an advisor who knows how to do this or you're going to get
    hurt!</em> " Draco's face was fierce.
3296:
  text: |-
    "Ah," Harry said. "An advisor like Lucius?"
3297:
  text: |-
    "Like <em>me!</em> " said Draco. "I'll promise to keep your secrets from Father,
    from <em>everyone,</em> I'll just help you figure out whatever you want to do!"
3298:
  text: |-
    Wow.
3299:
  text: |-
    Harry saw that zombie-Quirrell was staggering in through the doors.
3300:
  text: |-
    "Class is about to start," said Harry. "I'll think about what you said, there's
    lots of times I <em>do</em> wish I had all your training, it's just I don't know
    how I can trust you so quickly -"
3301:
  text: |-
    "You shouldn't," Draco said, "it's too soon. See? I'll give you good advice even
    if it hurts me. But we should maybe <em>hurry up</em> and become closer
    friends."
3302:
  text: |-
    "I'm open to that," said Harry, who was already trying to figure out how to
    exploit it.
3303:
  text: |-
    "Another bit of advice," Draco said hurriedly as Quirrell slouched toward his
    desk, "right now everyone in Slytherin's wondering about you, so if you're
    courting us, which I think you are, you should do something that signals
    friendship to Slytherin. <em>Soon</em>, like today or tomorrow."
3304:
  text: |-
    "Letting Severus go on awarding extra House points to Slytherin wasn't enough?"
    No reason Harry couldn't take credit for it.
3305:
  text: |-
    Draco's eyes flickered with realization, then he said rapidly, "It's not the
    same, trust me, it's got to be something obvious. Push your mudblood rival
    Granger into a wall or something, everyone in Slytherin will know what that
    means -"
3306:
  text: |-
    "That is <em>not</em> how it works in Ravenclaw, Draco! If you have to push
    someone into a wall it means your brain is too <em>weak</em> to beat them the
    right way and everyone in Ravenclaw <em>knows that</em> -"
3307:
  text: |-
    The screen on Harry's desk flickered on, provoking a sudden wash of nostalgia
    for television and computers.
3308:
  text: |-
    "Ahem," said Professor Quirrell's voice, seeming to speak personally to Harry
    out of the screen. "Please take your seats."
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
3309:
  text: |-
    And the children were all seated and staring at the repeater screens on their
    desks, or looking down directly at the great white marble stage where Professor
    Quirrell stood, leaning on his desk atop the small dais of darker marble.
3310:
  text: |-
    "Today," said Professor Quirrell, "I had planned to teach you your first
    defensive spell, a small shield that was the ancestor of today's
    <em>Protego.</em> But on second thought I have changed today's lesson plan in
    the light of recent events."
3311:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell's gaze searched the rows of seats. Harry winced from where he
    was sitting, in the back row. He had a feeling he knew who was about to be
    called on.
3312:
  text: |-
    "Draco, of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Malfoy," said Professor Quirrell.
3313:
  text: |-
    Whew.
3314:
  text: |-
    "Yes, Professor?" said Draco. His voice was amplified, seeming to come from the
    repeater screen on Harry's desk, which showed Draco's face as he spoke. Then the
    screen shifted back to Professor Quirrell, who said:
3315:
  text: |-
    "Is it your ambition to become the next Dark Lord?"
3316:
  text: |-
    "That's an odd question, Professor," said Draco. "I mean, who'd be dumb enough
    to admit it?"
3317:
  text: |-
    A few students laughed, but not many.
3318:
  text: |-
    "Indeed," said Professor Quirrell. "So while there's no point in asking any of
    you, it would not surprise me in the slightest if there were a student or two in
    my classes who harbored ambitions of being the next Dark Lord. After all,
    <em>I</em> wanted to be the next Dark Lord when <em>I</em> was a young
    Slytherin."
3319:
  text: |-
    This time the laughter was much more widespread.
3320:
  text: |-
    "Well, it <em>is</em> the House of the ambitious, after all," Professor Quirrell
    said, smiling. "I didn't realize until later that what I really enjoyed was
    Battle Magic, and that my true ambition was to become a great fighting wizard
    and someday teach at Hogwarts. In any case, when I was thirteen years old, I
    read through the historical sections of the Hogwarts library, scrutinizing the
    lives and fates of past Dark Lords, and I made a list of all the mistakes that
    <em>I</em> would never make when <em>I</em> was a Dark Lord -"
3321:
  text: |-
    Harry giggled before he could stop himself.
3322:
  text: |-
    "Yes, Mr. Potter, very amusing. So, Mr. Potter, can you guess what was the very
    first item on that list?"
3323:
  text: |-
    <em>Great.</em> "Um... never use a complicated way of dealing with an enemy when
    you can just Abracadabra them?"
3324:
  text: |-
    "The <em>term,</em> Mr. Potter, is <em>Avada Kedavra,</em>" Professor Quirrell's
    voice sounded a bit sharp for some reason, "and no, that was <em>not</em> on the
    list I made at age thirteen. Would you care to guess again?"

        His voice is sharp for the reason given in

      </p>
3325:
  text: |-
    "Ah... never brag to anyone about your evil master plan?"
3326:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell laughed. "Ah, now <em>that</em> was number two. My, Mr.
    Potter, have we been reading the same books?"
3327:
  text: |-
    There was more laughter, with an undertone of nervousness. Harry clenched his
    jaw tightly shut and said nothing. A denial would accomplish nothing.
3328:
  text: |-
    "But no. The <em>first</em> item was, 'I will not go around provoking strong,
    vicious enemies.' The history of the world would be very different if Mornelithe
    Falconsbane or Hitler had grasped that elementary point. Now <em>if,</em> Mr.
    Potter - just <em>if</em> by some chance you harbor an ambition similar to the
    one I held as a young Slytherin - even so, I hope it is not your ambition to
    become a <em>stupid</em> Dark Lord."
3329:
  text: |-
    "Professor Quirrell," Harry said, gritting his teeth, "I am a <em>Ravenclaw</em>
    and it is not my ambition to be stupid, period. I know that what I did today was
    dumb. But it wasn't <em>Dark!</em> I was <em>not</em> the one who threw the
    first punch in that fight!"
3330:
  text: |-
    "You, Mr. Potter, are an idiot. But then so was I at your age. Thus I
    anticipated your answer and altered today's lesson plan accordingly. Mr. Gregory
    Goyle, if you would come forward, please?"
3331:
  text: |-
    There was a surprised pause in the classroom. Harry hadn't been expecting that.
3332:
  text: |-
    Neither, from the looks of it, had Mr. Goyle, who looked rather uncertain and
    worried as he mounted the marble stage and approached the dais.
3333:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell straightened from where he was leaning on the desk. He looked
    suddenly stronger, and his hands formed fists and he drew himself up into a
    clearly recognizable martial arts stance.
3334:
  text: |-
    Harry's eyes widened at the sight, and he realized why Mr. Goyle had been called
    up.
3335:
  text: |-
    "Most wizards," Professor Quirrell said, "do not bother much with what a Muggle
    would term martial arts. Is not a wand stronger than a fist? This attitude is
    stupid. Wands are held in fists. If you want to be a great fighting wizard you
    <em>must</em> learn martial arts to a level which would impress even a Muggle. I
    will now demonstrate a certain vitally important technique, which I learned in a
    <em>dojo,</em> a Muggle school of martial arts, of which I shall speak more
    shortly. For now..." Professor Quirrell took several steps forward, still in
    stance, advancing on where Mr. Goyle stood. "Mr. Goyle, I will ask you to attack
    me."
3336:
  text: |-
    "Professor Quirrell," said Mr. Goyle, his voice now amplified as the professor's
    was, "can I ask what level -"
3337:
  text: |-
    "Sixth <em>dan</em>. You will not be hurt and neither will I. And if you see an
    opening, please take it."
3338:
  text: |-
    Mr. Goyle nodded, looking much relieved.
3339:
  text: |-
    "Note," Professor Quirrell said, "that Mr. Goyle was afraid to attack someone
    who did not know martial arts to an acceptable level, for fear that I, or he,
    would be hurt. Mr. Goyle's attitude is exactly correct and he has earned three
    Quirrell points for it. Now, fight!"
3340:
  text: |-
    The young boy blurred forward, fists flying, and the Professor blocked every
    blow, dancing backward, Quirrell kicked and Goyle blocked and spun and tried to
    trip Quirrell with a sweeping leg and Quirrell hopped over it and it was all
    happening too fast for Harry to make sense of what was going on and then Goyle
    was on his back with his legs pushing and Quirrell was actually <em>flying
    through the air</em> and then he hit the ground shoulder first and rolled.
3341:
  text: |-
    "Stop!" cried Professor Quirrell from the ground, sounding a little panicked.
    "You win!"
3342:
  text: |-
    Mr. Goyle pulled up so sharply he staggered, almost tripping and falling from
    the aborted momentum of his headlong charge toward Professor Quirrell. His face
    showed utter shock.
3343:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell arched his back and bounced to his feet using a peculiar
    springing motion that made no use of his hands.
3344:
  text: |-
    There was a silence in the classroom, a silence born of total confusion.
3345:
  text: |-
    "Mr. Goyle," said Professor Quirrell, "what vitally important technique did I
    demonstrate?"
3346:
  text: |-
    "How to fall correctly when someone throws you," said Mr. Goyle. "It's one of
    the very first lessons you learn -"
3347:
  text: |-
    "That too," said Professor Quirrell.
3348:
  text: |-
    There was a pause.
3349:
  text: |-
    "The vitally important technique which I demonstrated," said Professor Quirrell,
    "was how to lose. You may go, Mr. Goyle, thank you."
3350:
  text: |-
    Mr. Goyle walked off the platform, looking rather bewildered. Harry felt the
    same way.
3351:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell walked back to his desk and resumed leaning on it. "Sometimes
    we forget the most basic things, since it has been too long since we learned
    them. I realized I had done the same with my own lesson plan. You do not teach
    students to throw until you have taught them to fall. And I must not teach you
    to fight if you do not understand how to lose."
3352:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell's face hardened, and Harry thought he saw a hint of pain, a
    touch of sorrow, in those eyes. "I learned how to lose in a <em>dojo</em> in
    Asia, which, as any Muggle knows, is where all the good martial artists live.
    This <em>dojo</em> taught a style which had a reputation among fighting wizards
    as adapting well to magical dueling. The Master of that <em>dojo</em> - an old
    man by Muggle standards - was that style's greatest living teacher. He had no
    idea that magic existed, of course. I applied to study there, and was one of the
    few students accepted that year, from among many contenders. There might have
    been a tiny bit of special influence involved."
3353:
  text: |-
    There was some laughter in the classroom. Harry didn't share it. That hadn't
    been right at all.
3354:
  text: |-
    "In any case. During one of my first fights, after I had been beaten in a
    particularly humiliating fashion, I lost control and attacked my sparring
    partner -"
3355:
  text: |-
    <em>Yikes.</em>
3356:
  text: |-
    "- thankfully with my fists, rather than my magic. The Master, surprisingly, did
    not expel me on the spot. But he told me that there was a flaw in my
    temperament. He explained it to me, and I knew that he was right. And then he
    said that I would learn how to lose."
3357:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell's face was expressionless.
3358:
  text: |-
    "Upon his strict orders, all of the students of the <em>dojo</em> lined up. One
    by one, they approached me. I was <em>not</em> to defend myself. I was only to
    beg for mercy. One by one, they slapped me, or punched me, and pushed me to the
    ground. Some of them spat on me. They called me awful names in their language.
    And to each one, I had to say, 'I lose!' and similar such things, such as 'I beg
    you to stop!' and 'I admit you're better than me!'"
3359:
  text: |-
    Harry was trying to imagine this and simply failing. There was no way something
    like that could have happened to the dignified Professor Quirrell.
3360:
  text: |-
    "I was a prodigy of Battle Magic even then. With wandless magic alone I could
    have killed everyone in that dojo. I did not do so. I learned to lose. To this
    day I remember it as one of the most unpleasant hours of my life. And when I
    left that dojo eight months later - which was not nearly enough time, but was
    all I could afford to spend - the Master told me that he hoped I understood why
    that had been necessary. And I told him that it was one of the most valuable
    lessons I had ever learned. Which was, and is, true."
3361:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell's face turned bitter. "You are wondering where this marvelous
    <em>dojo</em> is, and whether you can study there. You cannot. For not long
    afterward, another would-be student came to that hidden place, to that remote
    mountain. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named."

        But you shouldn't leave the source of your power lying around! Tom Riddle
        knows that, even if Lord Voldemort doesn't.
      </p>
      <p>I think the implied timeline of events is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Monroe goes to the monastery, and gets training.</p></li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Monroe decides the monastery is too powerful to be left around for his
            enemies to use.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Lord Voldemort shows up to the monastery, as Quirrell describes, but
            slaughters everyone (not everyone less one survivor).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            David Monroe, the "sole survivor" who "was there" (who exactly can
            contradict him on that?), spreads the tale in the form that Professor
            Quirrell later tells his Defense class.
          </p>

          That's the intended interpretation; modulo that it wasn't <em>just</em> Rule
          Twelve, it was also how Tom Riddle was taught to lose. He did not learn
          <em>exactly</em> what the master hoped. He understood exactly what the lesson
          was meant to teach, for he is not foolish, but that is not the same as
          agreeing with the originally intended lesson.

        If Tom had destroyed the monastery on the spot, as Voldemort pretended to do,
        he would indeed have shown weakness. As it is, by Tom's lights, he showed his
        patience, got his revenge eventually, removed the source of knowledge from
        potential competitors, and built another brick in the story of Voldemort that
        would cause people to underestimate the real Tom in a way he could predict.

    There was the sound of many breaths being drawn in simultaneously. Harry felt
    sick to his stomach. He knew what was coming.
3363:
  text: |-
    "The Dark Lord came to that school openly, without disguise, glowing red eyes
    and all. The students tried to bar his way and he simply Apparated through.
    There was terror there, but discipline, and the Master came forth. And the Dark
    Lord demanded - not asked, but demanded - to be taught."
3364:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell's face was very hard. "Perhaps the Master had read too many
    books telling the lie that a true martial artist could defeat even demons. For
    whatever reason, the Master refused. The Dark Lord asked why he could not be a
    student. The Master told him he had no patience, and that was when the Dark Lord
    ripped his tongue out."
3365:
  text: |-
    There was a collective gasp.
3366:
  text: |-
    "You can guess what happened next. The students tried to rush the Dark Lord and
    fell over, stunned where they stood. And then..."
3367:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell's voice faltered for a moment, then resumed.
3368:
  text: |-
    "There is an Unforgiveable Curse, the Cruciatus Curse, which produces unbearable
    pain. If the Cruciatus is extended for longer than a few minutes it produces
    permanent insanity. One by one, the Dark Lord Crucioed the Master's students
    into insanity, and then finished them off with the Killing Curse, while the
    Master was forced to watch. When all his students had died in this way, the
    Master followed. I learned this from the single surviving student, whom the Dark
    Lord had left alive to tell the tale, and who had been a friend of mine..."
3369:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell turned away, and when he turned back a moment later, he once
    again seemed calm and composed.
3370:
  text: |-
    "Dark Wizards cannot keep their tempers," Professor Quirrell said quietly. "It
    is a nearly universal flaw of the species, and anyone who makes a habit of
    fighting them soon learns to rely on it. Understand that the Dark Lord did
    <em>not</em> win that day. His goal was to learn martial arts, and yet he left
    without a single lesson. The Dark Lord was foolish to wish that story retold. It
    did not show his strength, but rather an exploitable weakness."
3371:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell's gaze focused on a single child in the classroom.
3372:
  text: |-
    "Harry Potter," Professor Quirrell said.
3373:
  text: |-
    "Yes," Harry said, his voice hoarse.
3374:
  text: |-
    "What <em>precisely</em> did you do wrong today, Mr. Potter?"
3375:
  text: |-
    Harry felt like he was going to throw up. "I lost my temper."
3376:
  text: |-
    "That is <em>not</em> precise," said Professor Quirrell. "I will describe it
    more exactly. There are many animals which have what are called dominance
    contests. They rush at each other with horns - trying to knock each other down,
    not gore each other. They fight with their paws - with claws sheathed. But why
    with their claws sheathed? Surely, if they used their claws, they would stand a
    better chance of winning? But then their enemy might unsheathe their claws as
    well, and instead of resolving the dominance contest with a winner and a loser,
    both of them might be severely hurt."
3377:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell gaze seemed to come straight out at Harry from the repeater
    screen. "What you demonstrated today, Mr. Potter, is that - unlike those animals
    who keep their claws sheathed and accept the results - you do not know how to
    lose a dominance contest. When a <em>Hogwarts professor</em> challenged you, you
    did not back down. When it looked like you might lose, you unsheathed your
    claws, heedless of the danger. You <em>escalated,</em> and then you escalated
    <em>again.</em> It started with a slap at you from Professor Snape, who was
    obviously dominant over you. Instead of losing, you slapped back and lost ten
    points from Ravenclaw. Soon you were talking about leaving Hogwarts. The fact
    that you escalated even further in some unknown direction, and somehow won at
    the end, does not change the fact that you are an idiot."
3378:
  text: |-
    "I understand," Harry said. His throat was dry. That <em>had</em> been precise.
    <em>Frighteningly</em> precise. Now that Professor Quirrell had said it, Harry
    could see in hindsight that it was an <em>exactly</em> accurate description of
    what had happened. When someone's model of you was that good, you had to wonder
    whether they were right about other things too, like your intent to kill.
3379:
  text: |-
    "The <em>next</em> time, Mr. Potter, that you choose to escalate a contest
    rather than lose, you may lose <em>all</em> the stakes you place on the table. I
    cannot guess what they were today. I can guess that they were far, far too high
    for the loss of ten House points."
3380:
  text: |-
    Like the fate of magical Britain. That was what he'd done.
3381:
  text: |-
    ''You will protest that you were trying to help all of Hogwarts, a much more
    important goal worthy of great risks. That is a <em>lie.</em> If you had been -"
3382:
  text: |-
    "I would have taken the slap, waited, and picked the best possible time to make
    my move," Harry said, his voice hoarse. "But that would have meant
    <em>losing</em>. Letting him be dominant over me. It was what the Dark Lord
    couldn't do with the Master he wanted to learn from."
3383:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell nodded. "I see that you have understood perfectly. And so,
    Mr. Potter, today you are going to learn how to lose."
3384:
  text: |-
    "I -"
3385:
  text: |-
    "I will not hear any objections, Mr. Potter. It is evident both that you need
    this and that you are strong enough to take it. I assure you that your
    experience will not be so harsh as what I went through, though you may well
    remember it as the worst fifteen minutes of your young life."
3386:
  text: |-
    Harry swallowed. "Professor Quirrell," he said in a small voice, "can we do this
    some other time?"
3387:
  text: |-
    "No," Professor Quirrell said simply. "You are five days into your Hogwarts
    education and already this has happened. Today is Friday. Our <em>next</em>
    defense class is on Wednesday. Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday...
    No, we do <em>not</em> have time to wait."
3388:
  text: |-
    There were a few laughs at this, but very few.
3389:
  text: |-
    "Please consider it an order from your professor, Mr. Potter. What I would like
    to say is that otherwise I will not teach you any offensive spells, because I
    would then hear that you had severely hurt or even killed someone. Unfortunately
    I am told that your fingers are already powerful weapons. Do not snap them at
    any time during this lesson."
3390:
  text: |-
    More scattered laughter, sounding rather nervous.
3391:
  text: |-
    Harry felt like he might cry. "Professor Quirrell, if you do anything like what
    you talked about, it's going to make me angry, and I really would rather not get
    angry again today -"
3392:
  text: |-
    "The point is <em>not</em> to avoid getting angry," Professor Quirrell said, his
    face looking grave. "Anger is natural. You need to learn how to lose even when
    you are angry. Or at least <em>pretend</em> to lose so that you can
    <em>plan</em> your vengeance. As I did with Mr. Goyle today, unless of course
    any of you think he really <em>is</em> better -"
3393:
  text: |-
    "I'm not!" shouted Mr. Goyle from his desk, sounding a little frantic. "I know
    you didn't really lose! Please don't plan any vengeances!"
3394:
  text: |-
    Harry felt sick to his stomach. Professor Quirrell didn't know about his
    mysterious dark side. "Professor, we really need to talk about this after class
    -"
3395:
  text: |-
    "We will," Professor Quirrell said in the tones of a promise. "After you learn
    how to lose." His face was serious. "It should go without saying that I will
    exclude anything which could injure you or even cause you significant pain. The
    pain will come from the difficulty of losing, instead of fighting back and
    escalating the battle until you win."
3396:
  text: |-
    Harry's breath was coming in short, panicky pants. He was more frightened than
    he'd been after leaving the Potions classroom. "Professor Quirrell," he managed
    to say, "I don't want you to get fired over this -"
3397:
  text: |-
    "I will not be," Professor Quirrell said, "if <em>you</em> tell them afterward
    that it was necessary. And this I trust you to do." For a moment Professor
    Quirrell's voice turned very dry. "Believe me, they have tolerated worse in
    their hallways. This case will be exceptional only in that it happens within a
    classroom."
3398:
  text: |-
    "Professor Quirrell," Harry whispered, but he thought his voice was still being
    repeated everywhere, "do you really believe that if I don't do this, I might
    hurt someone?"
3399:
  text: |-
    "Yes," Professor Quirrell said simply.
3400:
  text: |-
    "Then," Harry felt nauseous, "I'll do it."
3401:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell turned to regard the Slytherins. "So... with the full
    approval of your teacher, and in such a fashion that Snape cannot be blamed for
    your actions... do any of you wish to show your dominance over the Boy-Who-
    Lived? Shove him around, push him to the ground, hear him beg for your mercy?"
3402:
  text: |-
    Five hands went up.
3403:
  text: |-
    "Everyone with your hand raised, you are an absolute idiot. What part of
    <em>pretending</em> to lose did you not understand? If Harry Potter does become
    the next Dark Lord he will hunt you down and kill you after he graduates."
3404:
  text: |-
    The five hands dropped abruptly back to their desks.
3405:
  text: |-
    "I won't," Harry said, his voice coming out rather weakly. "I swear never to
    take vengeance upon those who help me learn to lose. Professor Quirrell... would
    you <em>please</em>... <em>stop</em> that?"
3406:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell sighed. "I <em>am</em> sorry, Mr. Potter. I realize that you
    must find this equally annoying whether you intend to become a Dark Lord or not.
    But those children <em>also</em> had an important life lesson to learn. Would it
    be acceptable if I awarded you a Quirrell point in apology?"
3407:
  text: |-
    "Make it two," Harry said.
3408:
  text: |-
    There was a current of surprised laughter, defusing some of the tension.
3409:
  text: |-
    "Done," Professor Quirrell said.
3410:
  text: |-
    "And after I graduate I'm going to hunt you down and <em>tickle</em> you."
3411:
  text: |-
    There was more laughter, although Professor Quirrell didn't smile.
3412:
  text: |-
    Harry felt like he was wrestling an anaconda, trying to force the conversation
    through the narrow course that would make people realize he wasn't a Dark Lord
    after all... <em>why</em> was Professor Quirrell so suspicious of him?
3413:
  text: |-
    "Professor," said Draco's unamplified voice. "It is also not my own ambition to
    become a stupid Dark Lord."
3414:
  text: |-
    There was a shocked silence in the classroom.
3415:
  text: |-
    <em>You don't have to do this!</em> Harry almost blurted out loud, but checked
    himself in time; Draco might not wish it known that he was doing this out of
    friendship for Harry... or out of the desire to appear friendly...
3416:
  text: |-
    Calling <em>that</em> a <em>desire to appear friendly</em> made Harry feel
    small, and mean. If Draco had intended to impress him, it was working perfectly.
3417:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell was regarding Draco gravely. "<em>You</em> worry that you
    cannot pretend to lose, Mr. Malfoy? That this flaw which describes Mr. Potter
    also describes you? <em>Surely</em> your father taught you better."
3418:
  text: |-
    "When it comes to talking, maybe," said Draco, now on the repeater screen. "Not
    when it comes to being shoved around and pushed to the ground. I want to be
    fully as strong as you, Professor Quirrell."
3419:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell's eyebrows went up and stayed up. "I am afraid, Mr. Malfoy,"
    he said after a time, "that the arrangements I made for Mr. Potter, involving
    some older Slytherins who will be told <em>afterward</em> how stupid they were,
    would not carry over onto you. But it is my professional opinion that you are
    already very strong. Should I hear that you have failed, as Mr. Potter failed
    today, I will make the appropriate arrangements and apologize to you and
    whomever you have hurt. I do not think this will be necessary, however."
3420:
  text: |-
    "I understand, professor," said Draco.
3421:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell looked over the class. "Does anyone else wish to become
    strong?"
3422:
  text: |-
    Some students glanced around nervously. Some, Harry thought from his back row,
    looked like they were opening their mouths but not saying anything. In the end,
    no one spoke.
3423:
  text: |-
    "Draco Malfoy will be one of the generals of your year's armies," said Professor
    Quirrell, "should he deign to engage in that after-school activity. And now, Mr.
    Potter, please come forward."
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
3424:
  text: |-
    <em>Yes,</em> Professor Quirrell had said, <em>it must be in front of everyone,
    in front of your friends, because that is where Snape confronted you and that is
    where you must learn to lose.</em>
3425:
  text: |-
    So now the first year watched. In magically enforced silence, and with requests
    from both Harry and the professor not to intervene. Hermione had her face turned
    away, but she hadn't spoken out or even given him any sort of significant look,
    maybe because she'd been there in Potions too.
3426:
  text: |-
    Harry stood on a soft blue mat, such as might be found in a Muggle dojo, which
    Professor Quirrell had laid out upon the floor for when Harry was pushed down.
3427:
  text: |-
    Harry was frightened of what he might do. If Professor Quirrell was right about
    his intent to kill...
3428:
  text: |-
    Harry's wand lay on Professor Quirrell's desk, not because Harry knew any spells
    that could defend him, but because otherwise (Harry thought) he might have tried
    to jam it through someone's eye socket. His pouch lay there, now containing his
    protected but still potentially fragile Time-Turner.
3429:
  text: |-
    Harry had pleaded with Professor Quirrell to Transfigure him some boxing gloves
    and lock them on his hands. Professor Quirrell had given him a look of silent
    understanding, and refused.
3430:
  text: |-
    <em>I will not go for their eyes, I will not go for their eyes, I will not go
    for their eyes, it would be the end of my life in Hogwarts, I'll be
    arrested,</em> Harry chanted to himself, trying to hammer the thought into his
    brain, hoping it would stay there if his intent to kill took over.
3431:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell returned, escorting thirteen older Slytherins of different
    years. Harry recognized one of them as the one he'd hit with a pie. Two others
    from that confrontation were also present. The one who'd said to stop, that they
    really shouldn't do this, was missing.
3432:
  text: |-
    "I repeat," Professor Quirrell said, sounding very stern, "Potter is
    <em>not</em> to be really hurt. Any and all <em>accidents</em> will be treated
    as deliberate. Do you understand?"
3433:
  text: |-
    The older Slytherins nodded, grinning.
3434:
  text: |-
    "Then please feel free to take the Boy-Who-Lived down a few pegs," Professor
    Quirrell said, with a twisted smile that only the first-years understood.
3435:
  text: |-
    By some form of mutual consent, the pie-target was at the front of the group.
3436:
  text: |-
    "Potter," said Professor Quirrell, "meet Mr. Peregrine Derrick. He is better
    than you and he is about to show you that."
3437:
  text: |-
    Derrick strode forward and Harry's brain screamed discordantly, he must not run
    away, he must not fight back -
3438:
  text: |-
    Derrick stopped an arm's length away from Harry.
3439:
  text: |-
    Harry wasn't angry yet, just frightened. And that meant he beheld a teenage boy
    fully half a meter taller than himself, with clearly defined muscles, facial
    hair, and a grin of terrible anticipation.
3440:
  text: |-
    "Ask him not to hurt you," Professor Quirrell said. "Perhaps if he sees that
    you're pathetic enough, he'll decide that you're boring, and go away."
3441:
  text: |-
    There was laughter from the watching older Slytherins.
3442:
  text: |-
    "Please," Harry said, his voice faltering, "don't, hurt, me..."
3443:
  text: |-
    "That didn't sound very sincere," said Professor Quirrell.
3444:
  text: |-
    Derrick's smile widened. The clumsy imbecile was looking very superior and...
3445:
  text: |-
    ...Harry's blood temperature was dropping...
3446:
  text: |-
    "Please don't hurt me," Harry tried again.
3447:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell shook his head. "How in Merlin's name did you manage to make
    that sound like an insult, Potter? There is only one response you can possibly
    expect from Mr. Derrick."
3448:
  text: |-
    Derrick stepped forward deliberately, and bumped into Harry.
3449:
  text: |-
    Harry staggered back a few feet and, before he could stop himself, straightened
    up icily.
3450:
  text: |-
    "Wrong," said Professor Quirrell, "wrong, wrong, wrong."
3451:
  text: |-
    "You bumped into me, Potter," Derrick said. "Apologize."
3452:
  text: |-
    "I'm sorry!"
3453:
  text: |-
    "You don't <em>sound</em> sorry," said Derrick.
3454:
  text: |-
    Harry's eyes widened in indignation, he <em>had</em> managed to make that sound
    pleading -
3455:
  text: |-
    Derrick pushed him, hard, and Harry fell to the mat on his hands and knees.
3456:
  text: |-
    The blue fabric seemed to waver in Harry's vision, not far away.
3457:
  text: |-
    He was beginning to doubt Professor Quirrell's real motives in teaching this so-
    called <em>lesson.</em>
3458:
  text: |-
    A foot rested on Harry's buttocks and a moment later Harry was pushed hard to
    the side, sending him sprawling on his back.
3459:
  text: |-
    Derrick laughed. "This is <em>fun,</em>" he said.
3460:
  text: |-
    All he had to do was say it was over. And report the whole thing to the
    Headmaster's office. That would be the end of this <em>Defense Professor</em>
    and his ill-fated stay at Hogwarts and... Professor McGonagall would be angry
    about that, but...
3461:
  text: |-
    (An image of Professor McGonagall's face flashed before his eyes, she didn't
    look angry, just sad -)
3462:
  text: |-
    "Now tell him that he's better than you, Potter," said Professor Quirrell's
    voice.
3463:
  text: |-
    "You're, better, than, me."
3464:
  text: |-
    Harry started to raise himself and Derrick put a foot on his chest and shoved
    him back down to the mat.
3465:
  text: |-
    The world was becoming transparent as crystal. Lines of action and their
    consequences stretched out before him in utter clarity. The fool wouldn't be
    expecting him to strike back, a quick hit in the groin would stun him long
    enough for -
3466:
  text: |-
    "Try again," said Professor Quirrell and with a sudden sharp motion Harry rolled
    and sprang to his feet and whirled on where stood his real enemy, the Defense
    Professor -
3467:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell said, "You have no patience."
3468:

    Harry faltered. His mind, well-honed in pessimism, drew a picture of a wizened
    old man with blood pouring from his mouth after Harry had ripped his tongue out
    -

    A moment later, Derrick pushed Harry to the mat again and then sat down on him,
    sending Harry's breath whooshing out.
3470:
  text: |-
    "Stop!" Harry screamed. "Please stop!"
3471:
  text: |-
    "Better," said Professor Quirrell. "That even sounded sincere."
3472:
  text: |-
    It <em>had</em> been. That was the horrible thing, the sickening thing, it
    <em>had</em> been sincere. Harry was panting rapidly, fear and cold anger both
    flushing through him -
3473:
  text: |-
    "Lose," said Professor Quirrell.
3474:
  text: |-
    "I, lose," Harry forced out.
3475:
  text: |-
    "I like it," Derrick said from on top of him. "Lose some more."
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
3476:
  text: |-
    Hands shoved Harry, sending him stumbling across the circle of older Slytherins
    to another set of hands that shoved him again. Harry had long since passed the
    point of trying not to cry, and was now just trying not to fall down.
3477:
  text: |-
    "What are you, Potter?" said Derrick.
3478:
  text: |-
    "A, l-loser, I lose, I give up, you win, you're b-better, than me, please stop
    -"
3479:
  text: |-
    Harry tripped over a foot and went crashing to the ground, hands not quite able
    to catch himself. He was dazed for a moment, then began struggling to his feet
    again -
3480:
  text: |-
    "<em>Enough!</em> " said Professor Quirrell's voice, sounding sharp enough to
    cut iron. "Step away from Mr. Potter!"
3481:
  text: |-
    Harry saw the surprised looks on their faces. The chill in his blood, which had
    been flowing and ebbing, smiled in cold satisfaction.
3482:
  text: |-
    Then Harry collapsed to the mat.
3483:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell talked. There were gasps from the older Slytherins.
3484:
  text: |-
    "And I believe the scion of Malfoy has something he wants to explain to you as
    well," finished Professor Quirrell.
3485:
  text: |-
    Draco's voice started talking. His voice sounded almost as sharp as professor
    Quirrell's, it had acquired the same cadence Draco had used to imitate his
    father, and it was saying things like <em>could have put Slytherin House in
    jeopardy</em> and <em>who knows how many allies in this school alone</em> and
    <em>total lack of awareness, never mind cunning</em> and <em>dull thugs, useful
    for nothing but lackeys</em> and something in Harry's hindbrain, despite
    everything he knew, was designating Draco as an ally.
3486:
  text: |-
    Harry ached all over, was probably bruised, his body felt cold, his mind utterly
    exhausted. He tried to think of Fawkes's song, but without the phoenix present
    he couldn't remember the melody and when he tried to imagine it he couldn't seem
    to think of anything except a bird chirping.
3487:
  text: |-
    Then Draco stopped talking and Professor Quirrell told the older Slytherins they
    were dismissed, and Harry opened his eyes and struggled to sit up, "Wait," Harry
    said, forcing the words out, "there's something, I want, to say, to them -"
3488:
  text: |-
    "Wait on Mr. Potter," Professor Quirrell said coldly to the departing
    Slytherins.
3489:
  text: |-
    Harry swayed to his feet. He was careful not to look in the direction of his
    classmates. He didn't want to see how they were looking at him now. He didn't
    want to see their pity.
3490:
  text: |-
    So instead Harry looked at the older Slytherins, who still seemed to be in a
    state of shock. They stared back at him. Dread was on their faces.
3491:
  text: |-
    His dark side, when it was in control, had held to the imagination of this
    moment, and went on pretending to lose.
3492:
  text: |-
    Harry said, "No one will -"
3493:
  text: |-
    "Stop," said Professor Quirrell. "If that's what I think it is, please wait
    until after they're gone. They'll hear about it later. We all have our lessons
    to learn, Mr. Potter."
3494:
  text: |-
    "All right," Harry said.
3495:
  text: |-
    "You. Go."
3496:
  text: |-
    The older Slytherins fled and the door closed behind them.
3497:
  text: |-
    "No one's to take any revenge on them," Harry said hoarsely. "That's a request
    to anyone who considers themselves my friend. I had my lesson to learn, they
    helped me learn it, they had their lesson to learn too, it's over. If you tell
    this story, make sure you tell that part too."
3498:
  text: |-
    Harry turned to look at Professor Quirrell.
3499:
  text: |-
    "You lost," said Professor Quirrell, his voice gentle for the first time. It
    sounded strange coming from the professor, like his voice shouldn't even be able
    to do that.
3500:
  text: |-
    Harry <em>had</em> lost. There had been moments when the cold anger had faded
    entirely, replaced by fear, and during those moments he'd begged the older
    Slytherins and he'd meant it...
3501:
  text: |-
    "And are you yet alive?" said Professor Quirrell, still with that strange
    gentleness.
3502:
  text: |-
    Harry managed to nod.
3503:
  text: |-
    "Not all losing is like this," said Professor Quirrell. "There are compromises
    and negotiated surrenders. There are other ways to placate bullies. There is a
    whole art form to manipulating others by letting them be dominant over you. But
    first, losing must be <em>thinkable</em>. Will you remember how you lost?"
3504:
  text: |-
    "Yes."
3505:
  text: |-
    "Will you be able to lose?"
3506:
  text: |-
    "I... think so..."
3507:
  text: |-
    "I think so too." Professor Quirrell bowed so low that his thin hair almost
    touched the floor. "Congratulations, Harry Potter, you win."
3508:
  text: |-
    There was no single source, no first mover, the applause started all at once
    like a massive thunderclap.
3509:
  text: |-
    Harry's couldn't keep the shock from his face. He risked a glance at his
    classmates, and he saw their faces showing not pity but awe. The applause was
    coming from Ravenclaw and Gryffindor and Hufflepuff and even Slytherin, probably
    because Draco Malfoy was applauding too. Some students were standing up from
    their chairs and half of Gryffindor was standing on their desks.
3510:
  text: |-
    So Harry stood there, swaying, letting their respect wash over him, feeling
    stronger, and maybe even a little healed.
3511:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell waited for the applause to die away. It took quite a while.
3512:
  text: |-
    "Surprised, Mr. Potter?" Professor Quirrell said. His voice sounded amused. "You
    have just found out that the real world does not <em>always</em> work like your
    worst nightmares. Yes, if you had been some poor anonymous boy being abused,
    then they would probably have respected you less afterward, pitied you even as
    they comforted you from their loftier perches. That <em>is</em> human nature,
    I'm afraid. But <em>you</em> they already know for a figure of power. And they
    saw you confront your fear and keep confronting it, even though you could have
    walked away at any time. Did you think less of <em>me</em> when I told you that
    I had deliberately endured being spat upon?"
3513:
  text: |-
    Harry felt a burning sensation in his throat and frantically clamped down. He
    didn't trust this miraculous respect enough to start crying again in front of
    it.
3514:
  text: |-
    "Your <em>extraordinary</em> achievement in my class deserves an extraordinary
    reward, Harry Potter. Please accept it with my compliments on behalf of my
    House, and remember from this day forward that not all Slytherins are alike.
    There are Slytherins, and then there are Slytherins." Professor Quirrell was
    smiling quite broadly as he said this. "Fifty-one points to Ravenclaw."
3515:
  text: |-
    There was a shocked pause and then pandemonium broke out among the Ravenclaw
    students, howling and whistling and cheering.
3516:
  text: |-
    (And in the same moment Harry felt something <em>wrong</em> about that,
    Professor McGonagall had been right, there <em>should</em> have been
    consequences, there should have been a cost and a price to be paid, you couldn't
    just put everything back the way it was like that -)
3517:
  text: |-
    But Harry saw the elated faces in Ravenclaw and knew he couldn't possibly say
    no.
3518:
  text: |-
    His brain made a suggestion. It was a good suggestion. Harry could not even
    believe his brain was still keeping him upright, let alone producing good
    suggestions.
3519:
  text: |-
    "Professor Quirrell," Harry said, as clearly as he could through his burning
    throat. "You are everything a member of your House should be, and I think you
    must be just what Salazar Slytherin had in mind when he helped found Hogwarts. I
    thank you and your House," Draco was very slightly nodding and subtly turning
    his finger, <em>keep going</em>, "and I think this calls for three cheers for
    Slytherin. With me, everyone?" Harry paused. "<em>Huzzah!</em> " Only a few
    people managed to join in on the first try. "<em>Huzzah!</em> " This time most
    of Ravenclaw was in on it. "<em>Huzzah!</em> " That was almost all of Ravenclaw,
    a scattering of Hufflepuffs and around a quarter of Gryffindor.
3520:
  text: |-
    Draco's hand moved into a small, quick, thumbs-up gesture.
3521:
  text: |-
    Most of the Slytherins had expressions of sheer shock. A few were staring at
    Professor Quirrell in wonder. Blaise Zabini was looking at Harry with a
    calculating, intrigued expression.
3522:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell bowed. "Thank <em>you</em>, Harry Potter," he said, still
    with that broad smile. He turned to the class. "Now, believe it or not, we still
    have half an hour left in this session, and that is enough to introduce the
    Simple Shield. Mr. Potter, of course, is going off and taking a well-earned
    rest."
3523:
  text: |-
    "I can -"
3524:
  text: |-
    "Idiot," Professor Quirrell said fondly. The class was already laughing. "Your
    classmates can teach you afterward, or I'll tutor you privately if that's what
    it takes. But <em>right now</em>, you're going through the third door from the
    left in the back of the stage, where you will find a bed, an assortment of
    exceptionally tasty snacks, and some extremely light reading from the Hogwarts
    library. You may not take anything else with you, particularly not your
    textbooks. Now go."
3525:
  text: |-
    Harry went.
