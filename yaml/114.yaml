    The gibbous moon riding higher in the cloudless sky, the stars and wash of the
    Milky Way visible in all their majesty within the darkness, all these shone down
    upon the graveyard to bear witness from their unimaginable distances.
18716:

    In the instant when Harry had realised there was no way at all left to save
    everyone, his mind's voices had fallen away, become one, a single purpose taking
    up every fraction of his mind.
18717:

    Fifty seconds.
18718:
  text: |-
    Forty seconds.
18719:
  text: |-
    Harry's eyes tracked slowly across the air, until his gaze landed on the first
    Death Eater, the one closest to him.
18720:
  text: |-
    Thirty seconds?
18721:
  text: |-
    Twenty seconds?
18722:
  text: |-
    "<em>Time'ss almosst up -"</em> hissed Voldemort.
18723:
  text: |-
    "<em>I do know ssecretss you would like to know,</em>" Harry hissed. He didn't
    look directly at the Dark Lord as he spoke. "<em>But mosst valuable knowledge to
    you, I think, would be my ideass ass to how world might be desstroyed. Yet, to
    tell you ssuch thoughtss might lead to desstruction of world. Do not know
    prophecy, but if there iss prophecy, that makess it more than ussually probable
    that any action I take might have that effect. Or to tell you ssuch might
    prevent desstruction of world, ssince you do sseem motivated to avoid it. Not
    allowed to make ssuch a decission mysself. Would need to awaken and conssult
    girl-child friend. Vow requiress."</em>
18724:
  text: |-
    There was a long pause. The Dark Lord, floating above and behind the curve of
    Death Eaters with leveled wands, began to laugh as Salazar Slytherin had thought
    a snake would laugh, cold amusement in the form of a hiss. "<em>Do you know how
    to desstroy world, then?</em> "
18725:
  text: |-
    "<em>Cannot deliberately try to imagine method. You might have way for sservant
    to ssteal my thoughtss. Vow prohibitss. But ssusspect I could devisse method, if
    girl-child ssaid to try.</em>"
18726:
  text: |-
    Harry's eyes drifted slowly to another Death Eater, and another.
18727:
  text: |-
    More snakish laughter. "<em>Clever. You have my complimentss for thinking of
    ssuch tacticss. But no.</em>"
18728:
  text: |-
    "<em>Know it iss annoying, but with world and your eternity at sstake, would you
    not -"</em>
18729:
  text: |-
    <em>"Greater rissk to world in introducing ssuch complicationss, delaying your
    end. I will sstudy Muggle ssciencess mysself, think of all you might imagine.
    Now sspeak ssuch ssecretss as you may tell me, or thiss endss.</em>"
18730:
  text: |-
    Slowly Harry's vision tracked across the graveyard in careful arcs, ignoring the
    Dark Lord except as a floating blackness in his peripheral vision. His mouth
    went on speaking with only half his attention. "<em>Have thought of idea you
    might not have conssidered, teacher. Your attempt to kill me might fail in
    certain sspecific way desspite all your precautionss, perhapss lead into my
    desstroying world later. Would not ordinarily deem probable, but with prophecy
    at hand, may well be sso.</em>"
18731:
  text: |-
    Voldemort went still, in the air. "<em>How?</em> "
18732:
  text: |-
    "<em>Am not obligated to tell you.</em>"
18733:
  text: |-
    A cold anger began to seethe through the snakish reply. "<em>Though I
    undersstand well your dessperation and attempted clevernesss, thiss beginss to
    annoy me. I will not withhold from killing you, for that iss sstill greater
    rissk. To fail to tell me your thought rissks desstroying world. Sspeak!</em> "
18734:
  text: |-
    "<em>No. Vow doess not obligate me to any possitive action.</em>"
18735:
  text: |-
    The Dark Lord stared down at Harry Potter, who glanced up at the angry face only
    briefly before his eyes went back to the next Death Eater. Some of them were
    shifting their stances slightly, but they stood still, and said no words as they
    leveled their wands. The silver skull masks could not be read.
18736:
  text: |-
    Then the Dark Lord began to chuckle again. "<em>Ssurvive your death, you think
    you might? No, child, my horcruxess are not linked to you alsso. I would know if
    they were. Or iss there other reasson you think you might ssurvive beyond my
    ways of enssuring your death?</em> "
18737:
  text: |-
    Harry didn't allow himself to be distracted. The repeated failures didn't
    matter, they only led into the next action in the chain - but he <em>still
    needed a next action</em> -
18738:
  text: |-
    <em>"Now sspeak a ssecret,</em>" the Dark Lord hissed, "<em>or I -"</em>
18739:
  text: |-
    "<em>Life-eaterss will purssue you alwayss, hate you alwayss, sseek you out
    wherever you go, if what I have jusst done wass ssuccesssful, I have caused them
    to be set upon you! Guardian Charm ssecret will be beyond you for long time to
    come, perhapss forever! Besst defensse againsst life-eaterss would die with
    me!</em> "

        Harry was too obvious. "After what I did just now". He did nothing but talk,
        which gives it away. Should have said something more ambiguous.

    "<em>Thiss iss sstarting to become ssad...</em>" the Dark Lord's voice trailed
    off. <em>"Ah. I ssee. Life-eaterss resspond to expectationss. You tell me I will

18744:

    The Dark Lord stood still in the air for a long moment.

    And Harry's eyes went on tracking slowly across the graveyard, as his hand
    remained tight upon his wand.

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          For that matter, why didn't Voldemort sense that Harry had conceived of (and
          was executing) a plan that would allow him to win?
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        It's established in text that Harry is feeling pure, focused concentration
        more than any such emotion, for exactly that reason.

    In the instant when Harry had realized there was no way left to save everyone -
18747:
  text: |-
    He couldn't speak any incantation in English. But Transfiguration was wordless.
18748:
  text: |-
    There was no material in contact with his wand's end except air, which couldn't
    be Transfigured. But Voldemort didn't know about partial Transfiguration, which
    Harry could use to Transfigure a tiny bit of the material from his wand itself.
18749:
  text: |-
    "<em>You're sstalling,"</em> the Dark Lord said. "<em>Jusst to delay death? Or
    with other purposse?</em> "
18750:
  text: |-
    Harry said nothing, his other work slowing as his mind sought a continuation of
    the conversation that would work even against the Dark Lord's will -
18751:
  text: |-
    <em>"Sspeak and tell me purposse, or thiss endss now and your friendss suffer
    for lifetimess!</em> "
18752:

    "<em>Lower Muggle weapon and do not point wand in my direction,</em>" Harry
    hissed, putting as much cold danger as he could into the snake's voice.
    <em>"Sspeak no commandss to sservantss. I do posssesss capabilitiess of which
    you are ignorant. Can usse one ssuch capacity to causse huge explossion almosst
    insstantly, without sspeaking incantation. Sslay your new body, all sservantss,
    Sstone sscattered to who knowss where.</em>"
18753:
  text: |-
    At his current level of practice Harry could Transfigure one cubic millimeter as
    fast as he could apply his will and magic.
18754:
  text: |-
    One cubic millimeter of antimatter.
18755:
  text: |-
    It wasn't a world-ending threat.
18756:
  text: |-
    Voldemort could have been carved from stone. "<em>You bluff, ssomehow.</em>"
18757:
  text: |-
    "<em>Not bluffing. Sspeaking in ssnaketalk, I tell you, I can do it almosst
    insstantly, before any sspell can be casst at me, I think. You know very little
    of sscience ass yet. Power I would command iss sstronger than processs that
    fuelss sstarss."</em>
18758:
  text: |-
    "<em>Vow will sstop you,"</em> hissed Voldemort. "<em>You cannot rissk world.
    Take no risskss, none, with clever ideass!</em> "
18759:
  text: |-
    "<em>Would not rissk world. I esstimated ssize of explossion, nowhere near that
    large.</em>"
18760:
  text: |-
    "<em>You do NOT know, fool! Cannot be SURE!</em> "Voldemort's hiss was climbing
    higher.
18761:
  text: |-
    "<em>I am reassonably certain. Vow will not sstop me."</em>
18762:
  text: |-
    There was an increasing fury in Voldemort's expression, and yet his hiss carried
    a tinge of fear. <em>"I sshall wreak pain beyond imagining on all you care for
    -"</em>
18763:
  text: |-
    <em>"Sshut up. I dissregard all ssuch threatss now, as theory of gamess ssayss I
    sshould. Only reasson you make threatss iss that you expect me to
    resspond."</em> That, too, Harry had truly understood in the last extremity.
    <em>"Offer me ssomething I want, teacher. For your new body, for your continued
    holding of Sstone, for livess of your sservantss.</em>"
18764:

    Harry's mouth was running on automatic, his real attention elsewhere.

    From a tiny spot on the end of Harry's wand, a cubic millimeter of anchor,
    stretched out a thin line of Transfigured spider-silk. It would have broken at
    once, if tested; it would have gone unremarked, if any had noticed its glint.
    Less than a tenth of a millimeter in cross-section, the tiny shape represented
    by the extended line of spider-silk was something Harry could Transfigure
    swiftly, ten centimeters of length to a cubic millimeter of total volume; and
    Harry could Transfigure a cubic millimeter in a fraction of a second. He was
    forcing the Transfiguration outward, extending it through the air as fast as he
    could without risking the transformation.
18767:
  text: |-
    The tracing line of spider-silk looped around a Death Eater's hood at neck
    level, returned to the pattern of threads.
18768:
  text: |-
    Voldemort's face was now impassive. <em>"You musst not leave here alive.
    Ssenssible people called good would alsso agree, thiss I tell you in ssnake'ss
    sspeech. But all your friendss I will treat kindly and protect under my reign,
    if you agree to die now ass good persson sshould."</em>
18769:
  text: |-
    The last Death Eater was looped. The pattern of spider-silk was complete. The
    web had been drawn with loops around all the Death Eater's necks. The ends of
    those loops had been anchored to a central circle; and that central circle in
    turn had three threads stretching across its center. The entire pattern still
    touching the anchor-line stretching out of Harry's wand.
18770:
  text: |-
    Over the next seconds, those near-invisible threads of reflected moonlight
    turned black.
18771:
  text: |-
    Filaments narrower, stronger, and sharper than steel wire; braided carbon
    nanotubes, each individual tube all a single molecule.
18772:
  text: |-
    Harry hissed, "<em>Want you to alsso promisse to treat nationss kindly under
    your rule. Will not accept lesss."</em>
18773:
  text: |-
    Voldemort hovered still in the air, snake-face showing a dawning fury.
18774:
  text: |-
    The last two threads stretched out from the dark pattern, black theads already
    in the form of nanotubes. They moved lightly through the air toward the Dark
    Lord himself, toward the sleeve just above Voldemort's left hand that held the
    gun, toward the sleeve above the right hand that held the yew wand, threads
    placed high at first to give them time to drift slowly downward through the air.
    The threads looped around, went over themselves, tied slippable knots. Began to
    tighten, coming closer to the sleeve, as Harry Transfigured them shorter -
18775:
  text: |-
    Harry felt the tickle of Voldmort's power beginning to touch his own in the back
    of his mind; at the same time the Dark Lord's eyes widened, his mouth opened.
18776:
  text: |-
    And Harry Transfigured the black threads stretching across the black pattern's
    center to a quarter their previous size, shrinking the circle, yanking hard on
    everything attached, tightening loops.
18777:
  text: |-
    <em>(Black robes, falling.)</em>
18778:
  text: |-
    Harry wasn't looking there, he didn't see the falling masks, the blood, in the
    back of his mind he felt some explosions of magic like he'd felt when Hermione
    died but he ignored them, Harry's eyes only saw the Dark Lord's hands and wand
    and gun dropping downward, and then Harry's wand was rising, pointing -
18779:
  text: |-
    Harry screamed, <em>"STUPORFY!</em> "
18780:
  text: |-
    The red bolt the color of the Stunning Hex winged toward Voldemort, blazing
    across the graveyard almost faster than the eye could see.
18781:
  text: |-
    Without any hesitation despite his wounds the Dark Lord jerked down and right
    through the air.
18782:
  text: |-
    And the red bolt from Professor Flitwick's secret Swerving Stunner turned in
    midair and slammed into Voldemort.
18783:
  text: |-
    The pain that flashed through Harry's scar was searing, it made him cry out and
    a red haze appear across his vision, despite everything Harry dropped his wand
    in pain and sheer fatigue.
18784:
  text: |-
    As Harry let go of his wand, the pain began to clear -
