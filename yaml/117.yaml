    The morning after had come, and all the students had gathered silently around
    the four Tables of Hogwarts, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres among them. He had
    collapsed in exhaustion last night and been awoken in the infirmary next
    morning, still muzzy, with the Philosopher's Stone underneath his left sock.
18952:
  text: |-
    The Head Table looked like a plague had swept it.
18953:
  text: |-
    Dumbledore's throne was gone from the Head Table, without replacement, leaving
    the center of the Head Table empty.
18954:
  text: |-
    Severus Snape was sitting in a floating seat, the magical equivalent of a
    wheelchair.
18955:
  text: |-
    Professor Sprout was missing. According to what Harry had been told last night,
    a court Legilimens would examine her to see if any further compulsions remained,
    but probably no charges would be filed. Harry had emphasized to Professor
    McGonagall and the Aurors, as hard as he could, that Professor Sprout was
    probably just a victim. The Boy-Who-Lived had pronounced that he'd seen no
    evidence of Sprout's intentional guilt in Voldemort's mind.
18956:
  text: |-
    Professor Flitwick was missing, presumably still staying by Hermione's side.
18957:
  text: |-
    Professor Sinistra was missing and Harry didn't know why or where.
18958:
  text: |-
    The numbness that surrounded Harry's mind was like a Mylar blanket, protective
    if not comforting. There were scenes in his mind of black robes falling and
    blood spilling, appearing for an instant before being shoved back. He'd process
    it later, not now. Some other time would be better, future-Harry would have a
    comparative advantage at coping.
18959:
  text: |-
    Somewhere inside Harry was the fear that it <em>wouldn't</em> hurt, that there
    would be no price to be paid. But that fear also could be put off into the
    future.
18960:
  text: |-
    No breakfast had appeared on the tables. The students sitting near Harry were
    waiting in frightened silence. Owls had been prohibited from entering or leaving
    Hogwarts since early last night.
18961:
  text: |-
    The doors of the Great Hall opened once more, and forth came Deputy Headmistress
    Minerva McGonagall. She wore robes of formal black, and her head was bare,
    denuded of its usual witch's hat. Her grey-brown-blonde hair was done up in a
    coiled braid, as if in preparation for a hat to be placed later; but for now
    Harry saw her head bare for the first time.
18962:
  text: |-
    Minerva McGonagall came to the lectern that stood before the Head Table.
18963:
  text: |-
    All eyes were upon her.
18964:
  text: |-
    "I am afraid that I have much news," Minerva said. Her voice was sad, within its
    Scottish precision. "And most of it is terrible. First. The reason I am the one
    to speak to you is that the Headmaster of Hogwarts, Albus," her voice stopped,
    "Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, has been lost. You-Know-Who trapped him
    outside Time, and we do not know if he ever can be brought back to us. We, we
    have lost, what may have been, the greatest Headmaster, that Hogwarts has ever
    had."
18965:
  text: |-
    A susurration of horror arose across the tables, no audible gasps or moans, just
    the sound of many intaken breaths; most from Gryffindor, and some from
    Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw as well. The ill news had already been known, but now
    it had also been said by authority.
18966:
  text: |-
    "Second. You-Know-Who returned briefly, but is once again dead. All that
    remained of him was his hands clutched around Miss Granger's throat. There is no
    more threat from him, or so we think." Minerva McGonagall drew in another
    breath. "Third. Professor Quirrell died with his wand in his hand, facing You-
    Know-Who. He was found not far from where You-Know-Who perished again, a victim
    of You-Know-Who's Killing Curse." Another susurration of verified horror, now
    from all four tables.
18967:
  text: |-
    Minerva drew another breath. "Last night we also lost what may have been the
    greatest Defense Professor in the history of Hogwarts. His scholastic merits
    alone... Our Defense Professor has gone by many names, but his true name was
    David Monroe. As he was the last of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Monroe,
    his funeral - his second funeral, and the true one - will be held before the
    Most Ancient Hall of the Wizengamot, in two days. Yet a wake shall also be held
    for the Defense Professor of Hogwarts, for our own Professor Quirrell, in this
    castle. That man also died a Hogwarts teacher, as nobly as a Hogwarts teacher
    ever did."
18968:
  text: |-
    Harry listened in silence, shoving down the tears that again rose to his eyes.
    It wasn't even <em>true,</em> let alone unexpected; and yet hearing it still
    hurt. From where he sat beside, Anthony Goldstein put a comforting hand over
    Harry's hand, and Harry left it there.
18969:
  text: |-
    "Fourth. One piece of exceedingly unexpected and happy news. Hermione Granger is
    alive and in full health, sound of body and mind. Miss Granger is being observed
    at St. Mungo's to see if there are any unexpected afteraffects from whatever
    happened to her, but she appears to be doing astonishingly well considering her
    previous condition."
18970:
  text: |-
    It should have produced wild cheers from Ravenclaw and Gryffindor, if the news
    had come as part of any other package, or if it had been more unexpected. As it
    stood, Harry saw a few smiles, but they were brief. Maybe they'd jumped for joy
    earlier, but at the moment there was only silence. Harry understood that. He
    wasn't cheering either, not right now.
18971:
  text: |-
    "Finally -" Minerva McGonagall faltered, then raised her voice. "I fear that I
    have the gravest possible news to share with some of our students. It seems that
    You-Know-Who summoned those who were once his followers; and many of them
    obeyed, whether from terribly misguided loyalty, or out of fear for their
    families if they refused. A sacrifice was required, it seems, to complete You-
    Know-Who's resurrection; or perhaps You-Know-Who blamed his former followers for
    his defeat. Thirty-seven bodies were found, more followers outside Azkaban than
    You-Know-Who was thought to have. I am afraid -" Minerva McGonagall faltered
    again. "I am afraid that among the deceased are the parents of many of our
    students -"

        So to everyone who came here to post about how Harry should have tried to call
        someone in to Frigideiro and Transfigure the Death Eater's heads for later
        attempted revival...
      </p>
      <p>Harry hasn't thought of that yet.</p>
      <p>
        He hasn't yet spent enough time thinking about the information-theoretic
        criterion of death that he <em>automatically</em> looks at the recently
        severed head of a dead body and sees someone who's still alive and in need of
        saving.
      </p>
      <p>
        Harry is going to think of it a week later, maybe, while he's going through it
        in his head wondering if there was something better he could have done. I
        think that's what's realistic, all things considered. I didn't see that option
        for at least a day after I plotted out that point, so Harry shouldn't see it
        instantly either, especially when he's busy trying to not think about the
        awful thing he just did, or properly manage the guilt the way his model of
        Moody says he should.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sure is pointlessly tragic, huh? If only wizards did this sort of thing more
        often, so that Harry wasn't the only one who apprehended the possibility. By
        the way, everyone who came here to post about how Harry should have tried to
        call someone in to Frigideiro and Transfigure the heads, you
        <em>have</em> actually taken the time and undergone the minor inconvenience to
        sign up yourself and your loved ones up for cryonics. <em>Right?</em> Because
        it would be even <em>more</em> pointlessly ironic and tragic if you wrote
        about how silly it was for Harry to miss that, and then you didn't do anything
        about it yourself. Sort of like if I'd shown Harry criticizing a stage play
        where someone else had failed to preserve the severed heads of their enemies
        and the information inside, and then Harry himself didn't try to cool down
        Hermione in the crisis and just let her die. Hint hint HINT <em>HINT</em>
        <strong><em>HINT.</em></strong>

    As though by some terrible magnet, Harry's eyes were drawn to the picture of
    absolute horror that was Draco Malfoy's face, even as the comforting cotton wrap
    around Harry's thoughts was torn away like thin tissue.
18974:
  text: |-
    How could he have not thought, how could he have not realised -
18975:
  text: |-
    Somewhere in the background, someone was already screaming, and yet the room
    seemed very silent.
18976:
  text: |-
    "Sheila, Flora, and Hestia Carrow. Lost both their parents last night. Students
    who have lost their fathers include Robert Jugson. Ethan Jugson. Sara Jugson.
    Michael MacNair. Riley and Randy Rookwood. Lily Lu. Sasha Sproch. Daniel Gibson.
    Jason Gross. Elsie Ambrose -"
18977:
  text: |-
    <em>Maybe Lucius realised, maybe he was smart enough to stay away, maybe he
    realised that Voldemort was the one who struck at Draco -</em>
18978:
  text: |-
    "- Theodore Nott. Vincent Crabbe. Gregory Goyle. Draco Malfoy. This concludes
    the list."
18979:
  text: |-
    One student sitting at the Gryffindor table let out a single cheer, and was
    immediately slapped by the Gryffindor witch sitting nearby hard enough that a
    Muggle would have lost teeth.
18980:
  text: |-
    "Thirty points from Gryffindor and detention for the first month of next year,"
    Professor McGonagall said, her voice hard enough to break stone.
18981:
  text: |-
    "<em>Lies!</em> " shrieked a tall Slytherin, who'd risen up from that table.
    "<em>Lies! Lies! The Dark Lord will return, and he'll, he'll teach you all the
    meaning of -</em>"
18982:
  text: |-
    "Mr. Jugson," said Severus Snape's voice. It was also faltering, it didn't sound
    like the Potions Master at all, it wasn't loud and yet the Slytherin fell
    silent. "Robert. The Dark Lord killed your father."
18983:
  text: |-
    Robert Jugson let out a scream of terrific fury and turned to run out of the
    room, and Draco Malfoy folded in on himself like a collapsing house and made
    sounds that nobody heard, because the babble was starting up now.
18984:
  text: |-
    Harry rose six inches from the bench and then stopped.
18985:
  text: |-
    what would you say to Draco there is nothing you can say to Draco you can't go
    over there now and pretend to be his friend
18986:
  text: |-
    you want to make it right you want to make it better but you cannot make it
    right there is no way you can make right what you have done to him what you did
    to Vincent to Gregory what you did to Theodore
18987:
  text: |-
    The world blurred around Harry, he barely saw Padma Patil rise up and make her
    way toward the Slytherin table and Draco, or Seamus heading towards Theodore.
18988:
  text: |-
    And because Harry had read his father's science fiction and fantasy collection,
    because he had already read this scene a dozen times over when it happened to
    other protagonists, there was an image in Harry's mind of Mad-Eye Moody, of the
    scarred man called Alastor. And Mad-Eye's image was saying, in just the same
    voice he'd used to speak to Albus Dumbledore in memory, that the Death Eaters
    had been pointing their wands at Harry, that they had already chosen to take the
    Dark Mark, that they had been guilty of sins beyond reckoning and maybe beyond
    Harry's imagination, that they had foregone the deontological protection of good
    people and made themselves targetable if there was a strong reason to sacrifice
    them. That it had been necessary to save Harry's innocent parents from torture
    and Azkaban, that it had been necessary to protect the world from Voldemort.
    That plain old ordinary Aurors and judges had to do much more morally
    questionable things than killing sworn and blooded Death Eaters who were
    pointing wands at them, in the course of carrying out ordinary justices that
    were less clear-cut but still necessary to society. If it were not right to do
    what Harry had done, if it were not right to do much <em>more</em> morally
    ambiguous things than what Harry had done, then society as human beings knew it
    could not exist. Nobody with common sense would blame Harry for doing it,
    Neville wouldn't blame him, Professor McGonagall wouldn't blame him, Dumbledore
    wouldn't blame him, even Hermione would tell him it had been the right thing to
    do once she knew.
18989:
  text: |-
    And all of this was true.
18990:
  text: |-
    Just as it was also true that some part of Harry's mind had calculated that
    wiping out the blood purist political elite would make it easier and more
    convenient to rebuild magical Britain afterward. It hadn't been an important
    consideration, but it had still been calculated in those instants of rapid
    thought, a check on the long-term consequences to see if they rated as
    catastrophic, and a decision that they actually rated as pretty much okay. And
    that check had forgotten that Death Eaters had children at Hogwarts or that one
    of them wore the face of Draco's father. It wouldn't have changed anything. It
    wouldn't have changed anything at all. But that was the truth of the calculation
    Harry's mind had performed, given only seconds to think.
18991:
  text: |-
    At least Harry could, if the Death Eaters' survivors were in any sort of
    financial trouble, do something about that easily enough. Transfigure gold, and
    use the Stone to make it permanent - unless making that much gold would be
    troublesome to the wizard economy at large, or cause objections from goblins who
    didn't understand market monetarist economics - though it wasn't as though Harry
    didn't also have useful services to sell -
18992:
  text: |-
    Other cotton wrap was also being torn off Harry's thoughts, now.
18993:
  text: |-
    "It seems likely," Minerva said, her voice was not loud but it cut through all
    other sounds, "that some of our students will also have been stripped last night
    of those named as their guardians. Should you end up a ward of Hogwarts, please
    know that I will take the responsibilities of my position with extreme
    seriousness. You will be extended every courtesy. Your family's vault will be
    managed well and truly. As best I can, I will treat every one of you as I would
    my own children - and I will protect you as much as I would protect my own
    children, no more, no less. I hope that is clear to <em>EVERYONE AT
    HOGWARTS.</em>"
18994:
  text: |-
    Students nodded rapidly.
18995:
  text: |-
    "Good," Minerva said. Her voice sank back. "Then there is one more thing that
    must be done."
18996:
  text: |-
    With a sad, solemn air, Professor Sinistra emerged from a side entrance. She was
    wearing white robes instead of her usual brown, and instead of her customary
    witch's hat, she was wearing a many-tasseled square hat whose colors had faded
    into mostly gray.
18997:
  text: |-
    In her hands, Professor Sinistra carried the Sorting Hat.
18998:
  text: |-
    With the air of someone carrying out a ceremony that had not changed in
    centuries, Aurora Sinistra kneeled, on one knee, before Minerva McGonagall,
    presenting to her the Sorting Hat in both hands.
18999:
  text: |-
    Minerva McGonagall took the Sorting Hat from Professor Sinistra's hands, and
    placed it on her own head.
19000:
  text: |-
    There was a long silence.
19001:
  text: |-
    "HEADMISTRESS!"
19002:
  text: |-
    "As Albus Dumbledore is not dead," Minerva said, her voice so low that students
    strained to hear it, "but only taken from us, I accept this position in the
    capacity of Acting Headmistress only - until Dumbledore's return."
19003:
  text: |-
    A piercing cry split the Great Hall, and Fawkes was there, overflying all Four
    Tables in a slow spiral arc. He passed over each of the tables, humming in his
    bird's voice, a hum of absolute loyalty that would outlast the death of merely
    physical fires. <em>Wait,</em> the hum seemed to say. <em>Wait until his return,
    and be true.</em>
19004:
  text: |-
    Fawkes circled Minerva McGonagall three times, feathered wings brushing around
    her as the tears began to creep down her cheeks; then the bird flew out a window
    above the Hall, and was gone.
