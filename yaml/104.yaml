    <em>June 13th, 1992.</em>
17378:
  text: |-
    It was the last week of school in Hogwarts, and Professor Quirrell was still
    alive, barely. The Defense Professor himself would be in a healer's bed, this
    day, as he'd been for almost the last week.
17379:
  text: |-
    Hogwarts tradition said that exams were given in the first week of June, that
    exam results were released the second week, and that in the third week, there
    would be the Leave-Taking Feast on Sunday and the Hogwarts Express transporting
    you to London on Monday.
17380:
  text: |-
    Harry had wondered, a long time ago when he'd first read about that schedule,
    just what exactly the students did during the <em>rest</em> of the second week
    of June, since 'waiting for exam results' didn't sound like much; and the answer
    had surprised him when he'd found out.
17381:
  text: |-
    But now the second week of June was done as well, and it was Saturday; there was
    nothing left of the year but the Leave-Taking Feast on the 14th and the Hogwarts
    Express ride on the 15th.
17382:
  text: |-
    And nothing had been answered.
17383:
  text: |-
    Nothing had been resolved.
17384:
  text: |-
    Hermione's killer hadn't been found.
17385:
  text: |-
    Somehow Harry had been thinking that, surely, all the truth would come out by
    the end of the school year; like that was the end of a mystery novel and the
    mystery's answer had been promised him. Certainly it had to be known by the time
    the Defense Professor... died, it couldn't be allowed for Professor Quirrell to
    <em>die</em> without knowing the answer, without everything being neatly
    resolved. Not exam grades, certainly not death, it was only truth that finished
    a story...
17386:
  text: |-
    But unless you bought Draco Malfoy's latest theory that Professor Sprout had
    been assigning and grading less homework around the time of Hermione being
    framed for attempted murder, thereby proving that Professor Sprout had been
    spending her time setting it up, the truth remained unfound.
17387:
  text: |-
    And instead, like the world had priorities that were more like other people's
    way of thinking, the year was going to end with a climactic Quidditch match.
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
17388:
  text: |-
    In the air above the stadium, distant figures on broomsticks swooped and
    pirouetted and spun around each other. The red-purplish truncated tetrahedron
    that was the Quaffle was caught, tossed, blocked, and occasionally thrown
    through floating hoops, accompanied by stadium-rocking cries of triumph or
    dismay. Blue and green and yellow and red-trimmed robes shouted with the
    enthusiasm that people felt so easily when no action would be required from them
    personally.
17389:
  text: |-
    It was the first Quidditch match Harry had attended at Hogwarts, and he'd
    already decided that it would be the last.
17390:
  text: |-
    "Davies has the Quaffle!" shouted the amplified voice of Lee Jordan. "That's
    another ten points for Ravenclaw in seven... six... five... holy smokes, he's
    done it already! Smack through the center of the central hoop! I've never seen
    such a winning streak - I'm calling it right now for Davies becoming Captain
    next year after Bortan steps down -"
17391:
  text: |-
    Lee's voice cut out abruptly and Professor McGonagall's own amplified voice
    said, "That's the Ravenclaw team's own business, Mr. Jordan. Confine yourself to
    the match, please."
17392:
  text: |-
    "And the Slytherins take possession - Flint hands off the Quaffle to the lovely
    -"
17393:
  text: |-
    "Mr. Jordan!"
17394:
  text: |-
    "To the merely acceptable Sharon Vizcaino, whose hair trails behind her like a
    comet as she blazes toward the Ravenclaw defense - now with two Bludgers in
    close pursuit! Pucey's on Sharon's tail - what are you doing, Inglebee? - and
    she swerves in midair to avoid - IS THAT THE SNITCH? GO, CHO CHANG, GO, HIGGS IS
    ALREADY - WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING?"
17395:
  text: |-
    "Calm down, Mr. Jordan!"
17396:
  text: |-
    "HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO CALM DOWN? THAT WAS THE WORST MISSED PLAY I'VE EVER SEEN!
    And the Snitch is gone - maybe gone for good, after being missed that badly -
    Pucey's heading off towards the goal posts, Inglebee's nowhere near him -"
17397:
  text: |-
    In a distant era of history, maybe in another world entirely, Professor Quirrell
    had undertaken that the House Cup would be awarded to either Slytherin or
    Ravenclaw. Or possibly, somehow, both; for he had promised that three wishes
    would be granted. So far it was looking good on two out of three.
17398:
  text: |-
    If you just went by the current score, Hufflepuff was leading the race for the
    House Cup by something like five hundred points, thanks to Hufflepuff's students
    doing their homework and <em>staying out of trouble.</em> It appeared that
    Professor Snape had been strategically taking quite a lot of points from
    Hufflepuffs for, er, the last seven years or so. Slytherin House, reigning
    champion for the last seven years, still had to its advantage a certain
    <em>generosity</em> of its Head of House in handing out points; and this was
    sufficient to put it neck-and-neck with Ravenclaw House, home of the academic
    achievers. Gryffindor was far behind in the last place, as befit the House of
    nonconformists; Gryffindor had Slytherin's profile when it came to academics and
    mischief, only without the advantage of Professor Snape. Even Fred and George
    had barely broken even on the year.
17399:
  text: |-
    Ravenclaw House and Slytherin House both needed a lot of points from
    <em>somewhere</em> if either wanted to catch up with Hufflepuff in the next two
    days.
17400:
  text: |-
    And so far as anyone knew, Professor Quirrell hadn't done a single thing leading
    to the obvious result. It was happening all by itself, now that one lone
    Professor in Hogwarts had taught a class with creative problem-solving.
17401:
  text: |-
    The final Quidditch match of the year was between Ravenclaw and Slytherin.
    Earlier in the year, Gryffindor's initial Quidditch lead had vanished after
    their new Seeker, Emmett Shear, fell off a possibly malfunctioning broomstick
    during his second game. This had also required some hasty rescheduling of the
    remaining games.
17402:
  text: |-
    This, the final game of the year, wouldn't end until the Snitch was caught.
17403:
  text: |-
    Quidditch scores added directly onto the House points total.
17404:
  text: |-
    And what did you know, today it seemed that both the Slytherin and Ravenclaw
    Seekers just could... not... catch... the... Snitch.
17405:
  text: |-
    "THE SNITCH WAS PRACTICALLY ON TOP OF YOU, YOU DIM-EYED DIMWIT!"
17406:
  text: |-
    "Language, Mr. Jordan, or I'll remove you from this game! Though it <em>was</em>
    a terrible play, I admit."
17407:
  text: |-
    Harry had to admit that Lee Jordan and Professor McGonagall had a wonderful
    comedic routine, with Jordan as the banana-man and Professor McGonagall as the
    straight-woman; Harry now felt a little sorry to have missed it at the earlier
    Quidditch matches. It was a side of Professor McGonagall he hadn't seen before.
17408:
  text: |-
    A few seats down from where Harry sat in the Hufflepuff section of the Quidditch
    bleachers, there lurked the hulking form of Cedric Diggory. The Super Hufflepuff
    had observed the most recent near-air-collision between Cho Chang and Terence
    Higgs with the keen eye of a wizard who was a Seeker and a Quidditch Captain in
    his own right.
17409:
  text: |-
    "The Ravenclaw Seeker is new," Cedric said. "But Higgs is in his seventh year.
    I've played against him. He's better than that."
17410:
  text: |-
    "You think it's a strategy?" asked one of the Hufflepuffs sitting next to
    Cedric.
17411:
  text: |-
    "It would make sense if Slytherin needed some extra points to lead for the
    Quidditch Cup," Cedric said. "But Slytherin already has us beat for the title.
    What are they thinking? They could've won right there!"
17412:
  text: |-
    The game had started at six o' clock in the afternoon. A typical game would have
    gone until seven or so, at which point it would have been time for dinner. June
    in Scotland meant plenty of daylight; sunset wasn't until ten.
17413:
  text: |-
    It was at eight pm and six minutes, according to Harry's watch, when Slytherin
    had just scored another 10 points bringing the score to 170-140, when Cedric
    Diggory leapt out of his seat and shouted "<em>Those bastards!"</em>
17414:
  text: |-
    "Yeah!" cried a young boy beside him, leaping to his own feet. "Who do they
    think they are, scoring points?"
17415:
  text: |-
    "Not that!" cried Cedric Diggory. "They're - they're trying to <em>steal the Cup
    from us!</em> "
17416:
  text: |-
    "But we're not in the running any more for -"
17417:
  text: |-
    <em>"Not the Quidditch Cup! The House Cup!"</em>
17418:
  text: |-
    The word spread, with cries of outrage.
17419:
  text: |-
    That was Harry's cue.
17420:
  text: |-
    Harry politely asked a Hufflepuff witch sitting next to him, and another
    Hufflepuff sitting one row above him, if they could move aside. Then Harry drew
    forth from his pouch a huge scroll, and unfurled it into a 2-meter-tall banner
    which stuck in place in midair. The enchantment had been done courtesy of a
    sixth-year Ravenclaw who had a reputation for knowing less about Quidditch than
    Harry did.
17421:
  text: |-
    In huge, glowing purple letters, the sign read:
17422:
  text: |-
    JUST BUY A CLOCK
17423:
  text: |-
    2 : 06 : 47
17424:
  text: |-
    Beneath it was a Snitch, with a blinking red X over it.
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
17425:
  text: |-
    Second, after second, after second, the time counter incremented.
17426:
  text: |-
    As that counter rose higher, there seemed to be an awful lot of Hufflepuffs
    who'd decided that they wanted to sit next to Harry's banner.
17427:
  text: |-
    As the game dragged on past nine, there also seemed to be a lot of Gryffindors.
17428:
  text: |-
    As the sun set and Harry started using Lumos to read his books - he'd given up
    on the actual game a long time ago - there were a noticeable number of
    Ravenclaws who'd betrayed patriotism for sanity.
17429:
  text: |-
    And Professor Sinistra.
17430:
  text: |-
    And Professor Vector.
17431:
  text: |-
    And as the stars began to come out, Professor Flitwick.
17432:
  text: |-
    The climactic final Quidditch game of the year... dragged on.
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
17433:
  text: |-
    One of the things Harry hadn't planned on, when he'd decided to do this, was
    that he would still be out here at - Harry glanced at his watch - eleven-oh-four
    at night. Harry was now reading a sixth-year Transfiguration textbook; or rather
    he'd weighted the book open, illuminated by a Muggle glowstick, while he did one
    of the exercises. Last week, when the graduating Ravenclaws were discussing
    their N.E.W.T. scores, Harry had overheard that upper-year Transfiguration
    practice involved several 'shaping exercises' that relied more on control and
    precise thinking than raw power; and Harry had promptly set out to learn those,
    whacking himself hard on the forehead for not trying to read <em>all</em> the
    later-year textbooks earlier. Professor McGonagall had approved Harry doing a
    shaping exercise that involved controlling the way in which a Transfiguring
    object approached its final form - for example, Transfiguring a quill so that
    the shaft grew out first, then the barbs. Harry was doing an analogous exercise
    with pencils, growing out the lead first, then surrounding it with wood and
    finally having the eraser form on top. As Harry had suspected, focusing his
    attention and magic into a particular part of the pencil's ongoing
    transformation had proven similar to the mental discipline used in partial
    Transfiguration - which could indeed have been used to fake the same effect, by
    partially Transfiguring only the outer layers of the object. This way was
    proving relatively easier, though.
17434:
  text: |-
    Harry finished his current pencil and looked up at the Quidditch game, which
    was, check, still fantastically boring. Lee Jordan was commentating in a tone of
    dull disgust, "Another ten points - yay - whoopee - and now someone takes
    possession of the Quaffle again - ask if I care who."
17435:
  text: |-
    Almost nobody remaining in the stands was paying attention either, since
    everyone who'd remained in the stadium seemed to have discovered a new and more
    interesting sport, the debate about how to amend the House Cup rules and/or
    Quidditch. The argument had become heated to the point where all of the nearby
    Professors were barely keeping order at a level short of open combat. This
    argument, unfortunately, had considerably more than two factions. Some darned
    busybodies were proposing sensible-sounding alternatives to eliminating the
    Snitch entirely, and this was threatening to split the vote and sap the momentum
    for reform.
17436:
  text: |-
    In retrospect, Harry thought, it would have been nice to have Draco unfurl his
    own banner from the Slytherin side saying 'SNITCHES ARE AWESOME', to set the
    polarity of the debate. Harry had squinted over at the Slytherin section
    earlier, but he hadn't been able to spot Draco anywhere in the stands. Severus
    Snape, who could also have been sympathetic enough to play the villainous
    opposition, was likewise nowhere to be seen.
17437:
  text: |-
    "Mr. Potter?" said a voice next to him.
17438:
  text: |-
    Beside Harry's seat was standing a short but older Hufflepuff boy, someone who'd
    never before come to Harry's attention, holding out a blank parchment envelope
    with wax dripped on the front. The wax was also blank, without impression.
17439:
  text: |-
    "What is it?" said Harry.
17440:
  text: |-
    "It's <em>me,</em>" said the boy. "With the envelope you gave me. I know you
    said not to talk to you, but -"
17441:
  text: |-
    "Then don't talk to me," Harry said.
17442:
  text: |-
    The boy tossed the envelope at Harry and walked away, looking offended. It made
    Harry wince a little, but it probably hadn't been the <em>wrong</em> decision
    considering the temporal issues...
17443:
  text: |-
    Then Harry broke the unsigned wax seal and drew out the envelope's contents. It
    was parchment instead of the Muggle paper that Harry would have expected, but
    the writing on it was his own handwriting, if done with a quill instead of a
    pen. The parchment said:
17444:
  text: |-
    <em>Beware the constellation,<br/> and help the watcher of stars.</em>
17445:
  text: |-
    <em>Pass unseen by the life-eaters' confederates,<br/> and by the wise and the
    well-meaning.</em>
17446:
  text: |-
    <em>Six, and seven in a square,<br/> in the place that is prohibited and bloody
    stupid.</em>
17447:
  text: |-
    Harry took it in at a glance, then folded the paper again and put it back into
    his cloak with another exhaled sigh. 'Beware the constellation', really? Harry
    would have expected a riddle left by himself, to himself, to have been easier to
    interpret... though some parts were obvious enough. Clearly future-Harry had
    been worried about this paper being intercepted, and while present-Harry
    wouldn't ordinarily have thought of the local Aurors as 'the ones in league with
    the Dementors of Azkaban', maybe that had been the best way to say 'Auror'
    without potentially tipping off anyone else who read the parchment and did their
    own best to decrypt it. Translating the idiom back out of the Parseltongue he'd
    used during the Incident with Azkaban... that worked, Harry supposed.
17448:
  text: |-
    The note had said that Professor Quirrell needed help, and that whatever was
    going on needed to pass unnoticed from the Aurors, and from Dumbledore and
    McGonagall and Flitwick. Since Time-Turning was involved already, the obvious
    solution was to leave for the loo, travel back in time, and return to the game
    right after he'd left.
17449:
  text: |-
    Harry started to rise from his seat, then hesitated. His Hufflepuff side was
    remarking something about leaving the Auror escorts behind and not telling
    Professor McGonagall anything, and wondering if his future self was being
    <em>stupid.</em>
17450:
  text: |-
    Harry unfolded the parchment again, and took another glance at the contents.
17451:
  text: |-
    On closer examination, the riddle-verse didn't say that Harry couldn't bring
    <em>anyone</em> along. Draco Malfoy... was he missing from the Quidditch game
    because future-Harry, hours in the past, had brought Draco with him as backup?
    But that didn't make sense, there wasn't much marginal improvement in safety
    from bringing along another first-year...
17452:
  text: |-
    ...Draco Malfoy would certainly have been present, regardless of his personal
    feelings about Quidditch, to watch Slytherin clinch the House Cup. Had something
    happened to him?
17453:
  text: |-
    Suddenly Harry didn't feel as tired anymore.
17454:
  text: |-
    A trickle of adrenaline was starting to rise in Harry, but no, this wouldn't be
    like the troll. The message had <em>told</em> Harry when to arrive. Harry
    wouldn't be too late, not this time.
17455:
  text: |-
    Harry glanced over at where Cedric Diggory was looking back and forth, visibly
    torn between a clutch of Ravenclaws arguing that the Snitch had to be kept
    because it was traditional and rules were rules, and a pack of Hufflepuffs
    saying that it wasn't fair for the Seeker to be more important than the other
    players.
17456:
  text: |-
    Cedric Diggory had been an excellent dueling tutor to Harry and Neville, and
    Harry had thought they'd established a good relationship. More importantly, a
    student taking literally all of the electives would have his own Time-Turner.
    Maybe Harry could try to get Cedric to go back in time with him? The Super
    Hufflepuff seemed like a good spare wand to have by your side in any sort of
    sticky situation...
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
17457:
  text: |-
    <em>Later, and earlier:</em>
17458:
  text: |-
    Harry's watch now said 11:45, which translated into 6:45pm after looping back
    five hours.
17459:
  text: |-
    "It's time," Harry murmured to the empty air, and began walking down the third-
    floor corridor above the grand staircase, on the right-hand side.
17460:
  text: |-
    'The place that is prohibited' would ordinarily mean the Forbidden Forest; that
    was probably what someone intercepting the message was meant to think. But the
    Forbidden Forest was huge, and there was more than one distinguished location
    inside it. No obvious Schelling Point at which to rendezvous, or find some event
    that needed intervention.
17461:
  text: |-
    But when you added the 'bloody stupid' modifier, there was only one prohibited
    place in Hogwarts that fit.
17462:
  text: |-
    And so Harry set forth on that outlawed path where, if rumor spoke true, all the
    first-year Gryffindors had gone before. The third-floor corridor, on the right-
    hand side. A mysterious door leading to a series of rooms filled with dangerous
    and potentially lethal traps that nobody could possibly get through, especially
    if they were only in their first year.
17463:
  text: |-
    Harry didn't know himself what sort of traps awaited. Which, on reflection,
    meant that the students who'd gone through had been surprisingly scrupulous
    about not ruining the puzzle for others. Maybe there was a sign down there
    saying <em>Don't give it away, just as a favor to me, sincerely Headmaster
    Dumbledore</em>. All Harry knew so far was that the outer door would open to
    <em>Alohomora,</em> and that the final room contained a magic mirror that would
    show your reflection in some situation you found highly appealing, which was
    apparently the big payoff.
17464:
  text: |-
    The third-floor corridor was illuminated by dim blue light that seemed to come
    from nowhere, and the arches were covered with cobwebs, as though the corridor
    hadn't been used in centuries rather than just the last year.
17465:
  text: |-
    Harry's pouch was loaded with useful Muggle things, and useful wizarding things,
    and everything he'd found that could possibly be a quest item. (Harry had asked
    Professor McGonagall to recommend someone who could expand the pouch's capacity,
    and she'd just done it herself.) Harry had applied the Charm he'd learned for
    battles that made his eyeglasses stick to his face, regardless of how his head
    moved. Harry had refreshed the Transfigurations he was maintaining, both the
    tiny jewel in the ring on his hand and the other one, in case he was knocked
    unconscious. He wasn't literally ready for anything, but Harry was as ready as
    he thought he could be.
17466:
  text: |-
    The five-sided floor tiles creaked beneath Harry's shoes and vanished behind him
    like the future becoming the past. It was almost 6:49-<em>six, and seven in a
    square.</em> Obvious if you thought in Muggle math, otherwise not so much.
17467:
  text: |-
    Just as Harry was about to round another corner, something tickled at the back
    of his mind, and he heard a soft voice talking.
17468:
  text: |-
    "...sensible person... wait until later... after certain faculty had
    departed..."
17469:
  text: |-
    Harry stopped, then crept forward as lightly as he could, not going around the
    corner, trying to hear Professor Quirrell's voice better.
17470:
  text: |-
    There came a louder cough, and then the soft voice spoke again from around the
    corner. "But if they were also... to depart themselves... at that time..."
    murmured the voice, "they might think... this final game... makes for the best
    distraction... left in this year... a predictable distraction. So I looked... to
    see what people of significance... were not at the game... and I saw the
    Headmaster missing... but for all my magic can tell me... he could be in
    another... realm of existence... I also saw your own absence... so I decided to
    go... where you were. That is what I am doing here... now... what are
    <em>you</em> doing here?"
17471:
  text: |-
    Harry breathed shallowly, and listened.
17472:
  text: |-
    "And just how did you know where I was?" drawled the voice of Severus Snape, so
    much louder that Harry nearly jumped.
17473:
  text: |-
    A small, coughing laugh. "Check your wand... for Trace."
17474:
  text: |-
    Severus said something in magical pseudo-Latin, and then, "You dared tamper with
    my wand? You <em>dared?</em> "
17475:
  text: |-
    "You are a suspect... just like myself... so your false indignation is wasted...
    however finely crafted it may be... now tell me... what are you doing?"
17476:
  text: |-
    "I am watching this door," said the voice of Professor Snape. "And I will ask
    you to be off from it!"
17477:
  text: |-
    "On whose authority... are you ordering me... my fellow Professor?"
17478:
  text: |-
    There was a pause, then, "Why, the Headmaster's," came the smooth voice of
    Severus Snape. "I was ordered by him to watch this door during the Quidditch
    match, and as a Professor I must obey his whims. I shall have words about it
    with the Board of Governors later, but for now I am doing as I must. Now be off
    with you, as the Headmaster desires."
17479:
  text: |-
    "What? You mean I am to believe... that you abandoned your Slytherins... during
    their most important... game of the year... and leapt up like a dog... at
    Dumbledore's word? Well that... I must say... is entirely plausible. Even so...
    I think it would be wise... if I kept my own watch over you.. while you watch
    this fine door." There was a sound of rustling cloth and a soft thud, as if
    someone had sat down hard upon the ground, or maybe just fallen.
17480:
  text: |-
    "Oh, for the love of Merlin -" Severus Snape's voice now sounded angry. "Get up,
    you!"
17481:
  text: |-
    "Ba-blu-a-bu-bluh -" said the Defense Professor's zombie-mode.
17482:
  text: |-
    "Get up!" said Severus Snape, and there was a soft thud.

    <em>Help the watcher of stars -</em>

    Harry stepped around the corner, though it was possible that he'd have done so
    even without an intertemporal message. Had Professor Snape just <em>kicked</em>
    Professor Quirrell? That would have been foolhardy if Professor Quirrell had
    been dead and <em>buried.</em>
17485:
  text: |-
    A round-topped door of dark wood was framed within a stone arch, set within the
    dusty marble bricks of Hogwarts. Where a Muggle would have set a doorknob there
    was only a handle of polished metal; there were no visible locks, or visible
    keyholes. Set upon the wall to either side, a pair of torches burned, sending
    forth an ominous orange glow. Before the door stood the Potions Master in his
    customary stained robes. Beside the door, to the left side beneath the orange
    torch, slumped the form of the Defense Professor, back against the wall, head
    staring out at the surroundings. The eyes seemed to flicker, as if halfway
    between awareness, and emptiness.
17486:
  text: |-
    "<em>What</em>," said the towering form of the Potions Master, "are you doing
    here, <em>Potter?</em> "
17487:
  text: |-
    Going by facial expressions and tone of voice, the Potions Master was quite
    angry with Harry; and certainly was not Harry's co-conspirator in councils to
    which the Defense Professor had never been invited.
17488:
  text: |-
    "I'm not sure," Harry said. He wasn't sure what role he should be playing, and
    was, in desperation, falling back on simple honesty. "I think perhaps I'm
    supposed to be keeping an eye on the Defense Professor."
17489:
  text: |-
    The Potions Master stared at him coldly. "Where's your <em>escort,</em> Potter?
    Students are not to wander these halls alone!"
17490:
  text: |-
    Harry's mind was genuinely blank. The game was afoot, and nobody had told him
    the rules. "I'm not sure how to answer that..."
17491:
  text: |-
    The cold expression on Professor Snape's face flickered. "Perhaps I should call
    the Aurors," he said.
17492:
  text: |-
    "Wait!" Harry blurted.
17493:
  text: |-
    The Potions Master's hand hovered about his robes. "Why?" said the Potions
    Master.
17494:
  text: |-
    "I... I just think you probably shouldn't call them..."
17495:
  text: |-
    In a blur, the Potions Master's wand was in his hand. "<em>Nullus
    confundio!"</em> A black jet darted out and hit Harry, striking in the direction
    Harry had already started to evade. There followed four other spells, containing
    words like <em>Polyfluis</em> and <em>Metamorphus;</em> and for those Harry
    politely stood still.
17496:
  text: |-
    After all of those spells had failed to produce any effect, Severus Snape was
    staring at Harry with a dark glitter that now seemed genuine. "I suggest," the
    Potions Master said softly, "that you explain yourself, Potter."
17497:
  text: |-
    "I can't explain myself," Harry said. "I don't have the Time, not yet."
17498:
  text: |-
    Harry looked directly into the Potions Master's gaze as he said the words
    <em>myself</em> and <em>time</em>, widening his own eyes to try to convey the
    key information, and the Potions Master hesitated.
17499:
  text: |-
    Harry was frantically trying to work out who was pretending to be what. Since
    Professor Quirrell wasn't in on Dumbledore's conspiracy, Severus was pretending
    to be the evil Potions Master of Hogwarts, who'd been sent here by the
    Headmaster... and might or might not have actually been sent here by
    Dumbledore... but Professor Quirrell either thought, or was pretending to think,
    that someone needed to keep an eye on Professor Snape... and Harry himself had
    been sent here by future-Harry and had no idea why... and why were they all
    standing outside the Headmaster's forbidden door in the first place?
17500:
  text: |-
    And then...
17501:
  text: |-
    From behind where Harry stood...
17502:
  text: |-
    Came the growing sound of another set of footsteps, rapid and manyfold.
17503:
  text: |-
    Professor Snape stabbed his wand once, creating a burst of darkness that
    shrouded where the Defense Professor was lying. "<em>Muffliato,</em>" the
    Potions Master hissed. "Mr. Potter, if you must be here, then hide! Put on your
    invisibility cloak! My duty is to guard this door in case <em>he</em> comes
    here. And there has been - a <em>disturbance</em>, meant to draw the Headmaster,
    he thinks -"
17504:
  text: |-
    "Who -"
17505:
  text: |-
    Severus took a long stride forward and snapped his wand against the side of
    Harry's head. There was a trickling sensation like an egg had been cracked over
    him, the feeling of a Disillusionment Charm; and Harry's hands faded out,
    followed by the rest of him.
17506:
  text: |-
    The darkness shrouding one side of the wall dissipated like slow mist, and there
    was again visible the huddled form of the Defense Professor, who said nothing.
17507:
  text: |-
    Harry tiptoed away quietly as he could, then turned to watch.
17508:
  text: |-
    The approaching footsteps rounded the corner -
17509:
  text: |-
    "What are you doing here?" came many simultaneous cries.
17510:
  text: |-
    Trimmed in three sets of Slytherin green and one Hufflepuff yellow stood
    Theodore Nott, Daphne Greengrass, Susan Bones, and Tracey Davis.
17511:
  text: |-
    "<em>Where,</em>" said Professor Snape with mounting wrath, "are your
    <em>escorts,</em> children? First-years must be accompanied by a sixth or
    seventh-year student at all times! Especially you!"
17512:
  text: |-
    Theodore Nott raised his hand. "We're, um," said Theodore Nott. "We're doing
    what the Chaos Legion calls a team-building exercise... see, we realized just
    now that none of us had tried the Headmaster's forbidden chamber yet, and there
    wasn't much time left... and Harry Potter has authorized it, Professor, he said
    specifically that <em>you</em> mustn't interfere."
17513:
  text: |-
    Severus Snape turned to glance over at where Harry Potter had tiptoed; a storm
    seemed to be gathering on his brow, and a dark fury in his eyes.
17514:
  text: |-
    <em>I... maybe?</em> There was still one hour left on Harry's Time-Turner, so it
    was possible.
17515:
  text: |-
    "Harry Potter does not have that authority," the Potions Master said in a
    deceptively mild tone. "Explain yourselves, now."
17516:
  text: |-
    "Really?" said the form of Susan Bones. "Really? You're telling Professor Snape
    that Harry Potter authorized the mission, that's your idea of a bluff?" The
    young Hufflepuff turned to Professor Snape and spoke, her voice strangely firm.
    "Professor, this is the truth and it's urgent. Draco Malfoy is missing and we
    think he went down there -"
17517:
  text: |-
    "If Mr. Malfoy is missing," said Professor Snape, "<em>why have the Aurors not
    been notified?</em> "
17518:
  text: |-
    "Because of, because of <em>reasons!</em> " cried Daphne Greengrass. "There's no
    time, you've got to let us through!"
17519:
  text: |-
    Professor Snape's voice was now as sardonic as Harry had ever heard it. "Are you
    four morons under the impression that you are on some sort of adventure? Well,
    you are mistaken. I assure you that Mr. Malfoy has not passed through this
    door."
17520:
  text: |-
    "We think Mr. Malfoy has an invisibility cloak," Susan Bones said rapidly. "Do
    you remember the door seeming to open for no reason?"
17521:
  text: |-
    "No," the Potions Master said. "Now be gone from here. This place is off-limits
    for today."
17522:
  text: |-
    "This is <em>Dumbledore's</em> forbidden corridor," Tracey said. "The Headmaster
    himself said nobody was to come here. Who do you think you are, forbidding it
    too?"
17523:
  text: |-
    "Miss Davis," said the Potions Master, "you need to stop associating with
    Gryffindors, especially those named Lavender Brown. And if you are still here in
    one minute, I will file papers requesting your transfer into that House."
17524:
  text: |-
    "<em>You wouldn't dare!</em> " shrieked Tracey.
17525:
  text: |-
    "Hm," Susan Bones said, her face screwed up in concentration. "Professor Snape,
    do you occasionally open the door yourself, to check on whatever's inside?"
17526:
  text: |-
    Professor Snape froze in place. Then he spun and put his right hand on the metal
    knocker -
17527:
  text: |-
    Harry was watching the hand on the knocker, so he didn't notice what Professor
    Snape was doing with his left hand until he heard the sudden outcry.
17528:
  text: |-
    "No, in fact," said Professor Snape, now holding the choking head of Draco
    Malfoy by his collar, though the rest of Draco was still underneath his
    invisibility cloak. "A fine try, though."
17529:
  text: |-
    "<em>What?</em> " cried Tracey and Daphne.
17530:
  text: |-
    Susan Bones hit herself in the forehead. "I can't <em>believe</em> I fell for
    that."
17531:
  text: |-
    "So, Mr. Malfoy," Professor Snape said. His voice had lowered. "You sent your
    friends here on a ruse... just in the hopes that you could pass through this
    door? Now why would you do that?"
17532:
  text: |-
    "I think we should trust him -" said Theodore Nott. "Mr. Malfoy, we've
    <em>got</em> to trust him, he's the one Professor who would take our side!"
17533:
  text: |-
    "No!" cried Draco's floating head, from where Professor Snape was still grasping
    his collar. "You mustn't say anything! Stop!"
17534:
  text: |-
    "We've got to take the chance!" yelled Theodore. "Professor Snape, Mr. Malfoy
    finally worked out what's been going on this whole year, and why - Dumbledore is
    trying to get the Philosopher's Stone away from Nicholas Flamel! Because
    Dumbledore doesn't think anyone ought to have immortality! So Dumbledore tried
    to convince Flamel that the Dark Lord was coming back and needed the Stone to
    revive, and asked Flamel to give it to him, but Flamel wouldn't, and instead
    Flamel put the Stone in the magic mirror that's down there, and Dumbledore is
    finding out right now how to get it, and then he'll come for it and we've got to
    get to it first! Dumbledore really will be all-powerful if he gets the
    Philosopher's Stone!"
17535:
  text: |-
    "<em>What?</em> " said Tracey. "That's not what you said before!"
17536:
  text: |-
    "It -" Daphne said. She looked frightened, but determined. "It doesn't matter -
    Professor Snape, please, you <em>have</em> to believe me. I looked at the books
    Hermione checked out of the library, and she was researching the Philosopher's
    Stone just before someone killed her. Her notes said that something dangerous
    might happen if the Stone stays inside the mirror too long. We have to get it
    out of the castle right away."
17537:
  text: |-
    Susan Bones now had both hands over her face. "I'm not with them, I just came
    along to prevent anything even stupider from happening."
17538:
  text: |-
    Severus Snape was staring at Theodore Nott and the others. Then he turned his
    head to look at Draco Malfoy. "Mr. Malfoy," the Potions Master drawled. "How did
    you come to discover Dumbledore's plot?"
17539:
  text: |-
    "I deduced it from evidence!" said Draco Malfoy's floating head.
17540:
  text: |-
    Professor Snape's head swiveled back to Theodore Nott. "How did you intend to
    obtain this Stone from inside a magic mirror that could supposedly baffle
    Dumbledore himself? Answer me at once!"
17541:
  text: |-
    "We're going to take the whole mirror and send it back to Flamel," said Theodore
    Nott. "It's not like we want the Stone for ourselves, we just need to stop
    Dumbledore from stealing it."
17542:
  text: |-
    Professor Snape nodded, as though confirming something, and turned his head to
    look at the other students. "Tell me, have any of you noticed one of the others
    behaving in an unusual fashion? Especially if there is a peculiar object that
    they have in their possession, or they can use spells a first-year should not
    know?" Professor Snape's right hand now pointed his wand at Susan Bones. "I see
    that Miss Greengrass and Miss Davis are trying not to look at you, Miss Bones.
    If there is a mundane explanation, you would be wise to offer it
    <em>immediately.</em>"
17543:
  text: |-
    Susan Bones's hair turned bright red, though her face didn't change. "I suppose
    there's not much point keeping it mum any longer," she said, "since I'm
    graduating in two days anyway."
17544:
  text: |-
    "Double witches get to graduate <em>six years</em> early?" said Tracey Davis.
    "That's not fair!"
17545:
  text: |-
    <em>"Bones is a double witch?"</em> cried Theodore.
17546:
  text: |-
    "No, she is Nymphadora Tonks, a Metamorphmagus," Professor Snape said.
    "Masquerading as another student is extremely against regulation, as you are
    well aware, Miss Tonks. It is not too late to expel you from Hogwarts two days
    before your graduation, which would be a dreadful tragedy - from your
    perspective, that is. From my perspective it would be hilarious. Now tell me
    what exactly you are doing here."
17547:
  text: |-
    "That explains it," said Daphne Greengrass. "Um, is there <em>actually</em> a
    Susan Bones, or is the House dying out so they had you secretly -"
17548:
  text: |-
    The red-haired form of Susan Bones had a palm to her face. "Yes, Miss
    Greengrass, there's a real Susan Bones. She only sends me in when <em>you</em>
    lot are about to get into ridiculous amounts of trouble. Professor Snape, the
    reason I'm here is because Draco Malfoy was missing, and this lot
    <em>insisted</em> on trying to find him instead of calling the Aurors. For
    reasons the real Miss Bones said there was no time to explain to me, which I now
    realize were stupid. But young students must never go alone, and must be
    accompanied by a sixth or seventh year at all times. And now we found Draco
    Malfoy and we can all go back. Please? Before this gets any more ridiculous?"
17549:
  text: |-
    "<em>What in Merlin's name is going on here?"</em>
17550:
  text: |-
    "Ah," said Professor Snape, who was still pointing the wand at the red-haired
    form of Susan Bones, his other hand still grasping the collar below the
    disembodied head of Draco Malfoy, standing next to the crumpled form of the
    Defense Professor. "Professor Sprout, I perceive."
17551:
  text: |-
    "It's not what it looks like," volunteered Tracey Davis.
17552:
  text: |-
    The short, dumpy form of the Herbology Professor stormed forwards. She had, by
    this point, drawn her wand, though she wasn't pointing it at anyone. <em>"I
    don't even know what this looks like!</em> Down wands, all of you, <em>right
    now!</em> Including you, Professor!"
17553:
  text: |-
    <em>Distraction.</em> The thought came to Harry with sudden clarity. Whatever he
    was watching now, from where he stood invisibly and well back of the action, it
    wasn't <em>what was really going on</em>, it wasn't the true thread of the
    story, it had been <em>arranged</em>. Professor Sprout's arrival had broken
    Harry's suspension of disbelief; things like that didn't happen just for the
    sake of comedic coincidence. Someone was deliberately causing all this chaos,
    but what was the point?
17554:
  text: |-
    Harry really hoped he hadn't gone back in time and done this, because it did
    seem like the sort of thing he would do.
17555:
  text: |-
    Severus Snape lowered his wand. His other hand unfisted Draco Malfoy. "Professor
    Sprout," the Potions Master said, "I am here on the Headmaster's orders to watch
    this door. Everyone else present is <em>not</em> supposed to be here, and I ask
    you to see them cleared away."
17556:
  text: |-
    "A likely story," snapped Professor Sprout. "Why would Dumbledore set you of all
    people to guard the door to his playground? It's not as if he wants to keep the
    students out, oh no, they need to go in and get stuck in <em>my</em> Devil's
    Snare! Susan, dear, you've got a communications mirror, don't you? Use it to
    call the Aurors."
17557:
  text: |-
    The watching Harry nodded to himself. <em>That</em> was the point. The Aurors
    would take away everyone present at this terribly confusing situation, no
    excuses accepted, and then the door would be unguarded.
17558:
  text: |-
    But was Harry meant to go into the forbidden corridor himself? Or watch, to see
    who finally came once all the others were gone?
17559:
  text: |-
    A loud fit of hacking and coughing caused everyone to look at where the Defense
    Professor lay.
17560:
  text: |-
    "Snape - listen -" said the Defense Professor between coughs. "Why - Sprout -
    here -"
17561:
  text: |-
    The Potions Master looked down.
17562:
  text: |-
    "Memory Charm - implies - Professor -" The Defense Professor began coughing
    again.
17563:
  text: |-
    "<em>What?</em> "
17564:
  text: |-
    And the logic unfolded in Harry's mind in crystalline dismay, all the steps
    already suspected, the dreadful realization coming as a repetition with greater
    confidence.
17565:
  text: |-
    Someone had Memory-Charmed Hermione to believe she'd tried to kill Draco.
17566:
  text: |-
    Only a Hogwarts Professor could have done it without alarm.
17567:
  text: |-
    So all the true mastermind needed to do was Legilimise or Imperius a Hogwarts
    Professor.
17568:
  text: |-
    And the last person anyone would suspect would be the Head of House Hufflepuff.
17569:
  text: |-
    Snape's head snapped around, as Professor Sprout raised her wand, and the
    Potions Master managed to raise a wordless translucent ward between them. But
    the bolt that shot from Professor Sprout's wand was a dark brown that produced a
    surge of awful apprehension in Harry's mind; and the brown bolt made Severus's
    shield wink out before they touched, clipping the Potions Master's right arm
    even as he dodged. Professor Snape gave a muffled shriek and his hand spasmed,
    dropping his wand.
17570:
  text: |-
    The next bolt that came from Sprout's wand was a bright red the color of a
    Stunning Hex, seeming to grow brighter and move faster even as it left her wand,
    accompanied by another surge of anxiety; and that blew the Potions Master into
    the door, dropping him motionless to the ground.
17571:
  text: |-
    By that time pink-haired-Susan-Bones was surrounded by a multifaceted blue haze
    and she was firing hex after hex at Professor Sprout. Professor Sprout was
    ignoring the hexes to summon plant tendrils that entangled the younger students
    as they tried to run, except Draco Malfoy, who had again vanished beneath his
    invisibility cloak.
17572:
  text: |-
    Not-Susan-Bones stopped casting hexes. She leveled her wand, took a deep breath,
    and cried aloud an incantation that sent golden worms of light chewing into the
    shield around Professor Sprout. At that the Herbology Professor turned to face
    not-Susan, her expression vacant, a new set of plant tentacles rising in the air
    behind her. Those stalks were a darker green, and seemed to have shields of
    their own.
17573:
  text: |-
    Harry Potter murmured to the seemingly empty air, "Attack Sprout. Help Bones.
    Nonlethal only."
17574:
  text: |-
    "Yes, my lord," whispered Lesath Lestrange beneath Harry's Cloak of
    Invisibility, and the fifth-year Slytherin's presence moved off toward the
    fight.
17575:
  text: |-
    Harry looked down at at his own hands, and saw with a jolt of unpleasant shock
    that his Disillusionment Charm wasn't as complete as it had been before. There
    were hints of distortion in the air, each time Harry moved...
17576:
  text: |-
    Slowly, Harry stepped backward, until he came to a corner, and ducked behind a
    wall. Then he took out his communications mirror... which was blank and jammed.
    Of course. Harry levitated the mirror to where he could use it to see around the
    corner, and watch the end of the... distraction? <em>What was happening,
    why?</em>
17577:
  text: |-
    Professor Sprout and the form of Susan Bones were dueling in flashes of light
    and leaves; and the blazing green of a Greater Drill Hex erupted from midair and
    chewed halfway through the outer layer of Professor Sprout's shields. The
    Herbology Professor turned and fired a broad wash of yellow at where the Drill
    Hex had come from, but the spell didn't seem to hit anything.
17578:
  text: |-
    Yellow blazes, blue facets, dark green plant-tendrils and swirling purple flower
    petals...
17579:
  text: |-
    It was when Professor Sprout started firing arcs of crimson in all directions
    that one of the crimson blades caught something in midair, the Invisibility
    Cloak not concealing how the crimson arc was absorbed and winked out; and
    Lesath's presence beneath the Invisibility Cloak fell to the ground.
17580:
  text: |-
    And that gave not-Susan-Bones time enough to stand still, catch her breath, and
    scream something that inspired in Harry another surge of dread; and the white
    spark that blazed out went through Professor Sprout's chewed shields and her
    plant-armor and dropped her.
17581:
  text: |-
    Not-Susan-Bones went to her knees, panting, her robes soaked in sweat.
17582:
  text: |-
    Her head turned to look around her, at the bodies lying stunned on the floor or
    wrapped in vines.
17583:
  text: |-
    "What," said not-Susan. "What. What. <em>What.</em>"
17584:
  text: |-
    There was no reply. The victims entangled in Professor Sprout's vines weren't
    moving, though they did seem to be breathing.
17585:
  text: |-
    "Malfoy..." said the pink-haired form of Susan, still gasping for breath. "Draco
    Malfoy, where are you? Are you there? Call the Aurors already! Merlin damn it -
    <em>Homenum Revelio!</em> "
17586:
  text: |-
    And Harry found himself visible again, staring in his mirror at the form of
    Draco Malfoy half-visible beneath a shimmering cloak, standing behind not-Susan,
    pointing his wand at a gap in not-Susan's blue haze.
17587:
  text: |-
    Harry's mind moved in flashes of insight, too slow and yet too fast; even as
    Harry's mouth opened and he inhaled in preparation to shout.
17588:
  text: |-
    <em>beware the constellation<br/></em>there was a constellation named Draco<br/>
    if you could control a Professor you could control a student
17589:
  text: |-
    <em>"Duck!"</em> Harry shouted, but it was too late, a bolt of red light caught
    the back of not-Susan's head at point-blank, smashing her to the floor.
17590:
  text: |-
    Harry stepped around the corner and said, "<em>Somnium Somnium Somnium Somnium
    Somnium Somnium.</em>"
17591:
  text: |-
    Draco Malfoy's shimmering form collapsed in a heap.
17592:
  text: |-
    Harry took a moment to catch his breath. Then Harry said "<em>Stupefy!</em> "
    and verified that, yes, the Stunning Hex did hit Draco Malfoy's form.
17593:
  text: |-
    (You could be mistaken about whether a Somnium had really hit. Harry had seen
    enough horror movies, not to mention the business with the Sunshine Regiment,
    that he wasn't about to make <em>that</em> error again.)
17594:
  text: |-
    After a further reflection on this, Harry cast another Stunning Hex into the
    prostrate form of Professor Sprout.
17595:
  text: |-
    Harry gripped his wand, staring at the scene, breathing heavily from the
    exhaustion. He didn't have enough magic left to cast a messenger Patronus to
    Dumbledore and he <em>really really</em> should have thought of that possibility
    immediately this time around. Harry started to reach back to where his mirror
    had fallen, to see if it was now unjammed.
17596:
  text: |-
    And then Harry hesitated.
17597:
  text: |-
    His note to himself had said to avoid notice from Aurors, and Harry still
    <em>did not know what was going on.</em>
17598:
  text: |-
    The crumpled form of Professor Quirrell gave another series of racking coughs,
    reached out a hand to the wall beside him, and slowly pulled himself to his
    feet.

    "Harry," croaked Professor Quirrell. "Harry. Are you there?"
17600:
  text: |-
    It was the first time Professor Quirrell had ever called him by his first name.
17601:
  text: |-
    "I'm here," Harry said. Without any conscious thought, his feet were moving
    forward.
17602:
  text: |-
    "Please," said Professor Quirrell. "Please, I haven't... much time. Please take
    me... to the mirror... help me... get the Stone."
17603:
  text: |-
    "The <em>Philosopher's</em> Stone?" Harry said. He glanced around at the
    scattered bodies, but he couldn't see Draco anymore, the revealment had worn
    off. "You think Mr. Nott was <em>right?</em> I don't think Dumbledore would -"
17604:
  text: |-
    "Not - Dumbledore," gasped Professor Quirrell. "Because - Sprout -"
17605:
  text: |-
    "I understand," Harry said. If Dumbledore had been the one behind it all, he
    wouldn't have needed to mind-control a Professor in order to use Memory Charms.
17606:
  text: |-
    "Mirror... ancient relic... could hide anything... Stone could be there... many
    others want Stone... one sent Sprout..."
17607:
  text: |-
    Harry repeated rapidly, "The mirror down there is an ancient relic that can be
    used to hide things, and it would be one possible place to hide the
    Philosopher's Stone. If the Philosopher's Stone is inside the mirror then any
    number of people might want to get it. One of them is controlling Sprout and
    that would explain what their goal really is... only... that doesn't explain why
    Sprout's controller would go after Hermione?"
17608:
  text: |-
    "Harry, please," Professor Quirrell said. His breathing was yet more labored
    now, his voice came with excruciating slowness. "It's the one thing... that can
    save my life... and I find, now... I don't want to die... please, help me..."
17609:
  text: |-
    And somehow that tore it.
17610:
  text: |-
    Somehow that was a little too much.
17611:
  text: |-
    The sense of detachment that had come over Harry when Professor Sprout had
    arrived, the broken suspension of disbelief, was returning; his Inner Critic
    weighing up everything as though it were a set-piece. Timing, probability, so
    many people showing up at the same door, the Defense Professor's desperation...
    this whole situation didn't feel real. But he might be able to <em>solve it</em>
    if he just took time to think things through in advance, instead of running off
    at adventure's first call. All the accumulated experience from the last year had
    finally crystallized into something like a touch of battle hardening. An
    instinct born of past disaster was telling Harry that if he just rushed on
    ahead, he would end up afterward in a sad conversation, realizing that he'd been
    stupid. <em>Again.</em>
17612:
  text: |-
    "Let me think," Harry said. "Let me think for a minute before we go." He turned
    away from the Defense Professor, looking at the unconscious bodies draped in
    various shapes over the floor. There'd been so many puzzle pieces already, this
    last year, maybe everything would just fall into place with one more piece...
17613:
  text: |-
    "Harry..." the Defense Professor said in a faltering voice. "Harry, I'm
    dying..."
17614:
  text: |-
    <em>One more minute can't make the difference he's had the WHOLE YEAR to be sick
    it's IMPROBABLE that his life versus death would be precisely timed to rest on
    this last minute no matter what happened to Hermione -</em>
17615:
  text: |-
    "I <em>know!</em> " Harry said. "I'll think <em>quickly!</em> "
17616:
  text: |-
    Harry stared at the bodies and tried to think. There was no time for doubts, for
    caveats, no brakes or second-guessing just take the first thoughts and <em>run
    with them -</em>
17617:
  text: |-
    In the back of Harry's mind, fragments of abstract thought flitted past,
    heuristics of problem-solving that there was no time to rehearse in words. In
    wordless flashes they shot past, to set up the object-level problem.
17618:
  text: |-
    - <em>what do I notice I am confused by -</em>
17619:
  text: |-
    <em>- the first place to look for a problem is whatever aspect of the situation
    seems most improbable -</em>
17620:
  text: |-
    <em>- simple explanations are more probable, eliminate separate improbabilities
    that must be postulated -</em>
17621:
  text: |-
    Professor Snape had already been here then Professor Quirrell had arrived then
    Harry had arrived (via Time-Turner) then the adventuring party had arrived and
    Draco had been revealed (part of the party) then Professor Sprout had shown up.
17622:
  text: |-
    Too many people had shown up <em>synchronously</em> and that was too much
    coincidence, it was <em>improbable</em> that so many different parties would
    show up at the same location within a five-minute window, there <em>had</em> to
    be hidden entanglements.
17623:
  text: |-
    Label Sprout's controller as the mastermind who had ordered Hermione Memory-
    Charmed. The mastermind had sent Sprout.
17624:
  text: |-
    Professor Snape had said that the Headmaster had sent him to guard the door
    after there'd been some sort of <em>disturbance</em>, if the mastermind had
    caused that as a distraction then that explained Severus's presence as well.
17625:
  text: |-
    Harry wasn't sure any more that Draco had been controlled by the mastermind,
    that hypothesis had come to him in the spur of the moment, Draco might have just
    been trying to drop not-Susan so he could get into the corridor unhindered-
17626:
  text: |-
    No that was the wrong way to think, turn it around, try to <em>explain</em> the
    timed presence of Draco and his adventuring party, no time for self-questioning,
    <em>run with the hypothesis,</em> therefore suppose Sprout's mastermind had sent
    Draco or triggered his coming.
17627:
  text: |-
    That was three arrivals explained.
17628:
  text: |-
    Harry had shown up because his note to himself had told him to do so. That could
    be attributed to time travel.
17629:
  text: |-
    That left the Defense Professor who'd said he was following Snape, only that
    didn't <em>really</em> seem like an adequate reason for Professor Quirrell to
    show up it didn't really make Harry feel less confused and so maybe the
    mastermind had also controlled the timing of Professor Quirrell's presence
    somehow and even arranged for Harry himself to enter the time loop.
17630:
  text: |-
    Harry's mind hit a stumbling-block, he couldn't see how to extend that reasoning
    further.
17631:
  text: |-
    There was no time to stare blankly at stumbling-blocks.
17632:
  text: |-
    Without any pause or braking Harry's mind attacked the problem from a new angle.
17633:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell had deduced a controlled Hogwarts Professor from the need for
    some Professor to Memory-Charm Hermione which meant that Professor Sprout's
    controller had framed and then murdered Hermione which meant Professor Sprout's
    controller had detailed information about Hogwarts life and maybe a personal
    interest in the Boy-Who-Lived and his friends.
17634:
  text: |-
    Harry's mind finally threw up the relevant memory, Dumbledore saying that Lord
    Voldemort's strongest road to life was hidden here inside Hogwarts <em>run with
    the hypothesis</em> so that resurrection tool was the Philosopher's Stone hidden
    inside the mirror <em>why had Dumbledore put the mirror into a corridor first-
    years could get through no ignore this question it's not important right
    now</em> and Professor Quirrell had said the Philosopher's Stone possessed great
    healing power so that part also fit.
17635:
  text: |-
    But if it was the Philosopher's Stone that was hidden in the mirror to keep it
    away from the Dark Lord, that meant the mirror also contained the one thing in
    the world that could save the Defense Professor's life -
17636:
  text: |-
    Harry's mind tried to hesitate, to flinch away, feeling a sudden apprehension as
    to where this was going.
17637:
  text: |-
    But there was no time allowed for hesitation.
17638:
  text: |-
    -and that was also far too much coincidence just too much improbability if your
    mind didn't write it off as an amazing plot twist like you were inside a story.
17639:
  text: |-
    Could the putative Dark Lord also be manipulating Professor Quirrell so that
    Professor Quirrell would discover his supposed salvation at the right time so
    that Harry and Professor Quirrell would go get the resurrection tool from the
    mirror that might not even actually be the Philosopher's Stone and then the Dark
    Lord's avatar or some other servant would show up and seize it from them that
    would explain <em>all</em> the synchronies and negate every coincidence.
17640:
  text: |-
    Or Professor Quirrell had known from the beginning that the one thing that could
    save his life was hidden inside this mirror and that was why he had agreed to
    teach Defense at Hogwarts and now he was finally trying to get it but then why
    wait until he was this sick to even try and why had Sprout shown up at the same
    time as Professor Quirrell -
17641:
  text: |-
    Harry's mind faltered harder.
17642:
  text: |-
    His inner eye was looking in a direction it was afraid to look.
17643:
  text: |-
    <em>The note I sent myself said to help the watcher of stars. I wouldn't send
    myself a note saying that, if I hadn't already worked out in the future that it
    was the right thing to do - maybe the note is just telling me to get on with it
    -</em>
17644:
  text: |-
    A small note of confusion was promoted to conscious attention.
17645:
  text: |-
    The coded message on the parchment... one or two lines hadn't quite sounded
    right, hadn't sounded like the code Harry would expect himself to use...
17646:
  text: |-
    "Harry," whispered the dying voice of Professor Quirrell from behind him.
    "Harry, please."
17647:
  text: |-
    "I'm almost done thinking," Harry's voice said aloud, and Harry realized as he
    spoke the words that they were true.
17648:
  text: |-
    Turn it around.
17649:
  text: |-
    Look at it from the Enemy's perspective, from where the Enemy does their own
    intelligent planning, somewhere out of your sight.
17650:
  text: |-
    There are Aurors in Hogwarts, and your target Harry Potter is now fully on
    guard. Harry Potter will call in Aurors at the first sign of trouble, or send a
    Patronus to Albus Dumbledore. Considering that as a puzzle, one creative
    solution is to -
17651:
  text: |-
    - forge a supposedly Time-Turned message to Harry Potter from himself, telling
    Harry Potter <em>not</em> to call for help, telling him to be at the place and
    time you want him to be. You get the target himself to bypass all the
    protections he set up. You even bypass his protection of skepticism with the
    overriding authority of his own future self's judgment.
17652:
  text: |-
    It isn't even difficult. You can Memory-Charm some random student into
    remembering Harry Potter handing over an envelope to be given back to himself
    later.
17653:
  text: |-
    You can Memory-Charm that student because you are a Hogwarts Professor.
17654:
  text: |-
    You don't go to the extra effort to steal a pencil and Muggle paper from Harry
    Potter's pouch. Instead you forge Harry Potter's handwriting on wizard
    parchment. You can forge Harry Potter's handwriting because you have seen it on
    Ministry-mandated exams you have graded.
17655:
  text: |-
    You call Draco Malfoy 'the constellation' because you know Harry Potter is
    interested in astronomy and you are a wizard and you have taken Astronomy and
    memorised the names of all the constellations. But it's not the natural code
    that Harry Potter would use to describe Draco Malfoy to himself, that would have
    been 'the apprentice'.
17656:
  text: |-
    You call Professor Quirrell 'the watcher of stars', and tell Harry Potter to
    help him.
17657:
  text: |-
    You know that life-eater is how you say 'Dementor' in Parseltongue and you
    expect Harry Potter to think of the Aurors as being in league with them.
17658:
  text: |-
    You encode 6:49 as 'six, and seven in a square' because you have been reading a
    Muggle physics book that Harry Potter gave you.
17659:
  text: |-
    Who are you, then?
17660:
  text: |-
    Harry noticed his breathing had sped up, and with a burst of heartrate, Harry
    slowed his breath down again, Professor Quirrell was <em>watching him</em>.
17661:
  text: |-
    What if hypothetically speaking Professor Quirrell was the mastermind and had
    faked Harry's message then that explained all five parties showing up the whole
    synchronous coordination of the comedy and then Professor Sprout was just
    controlled to give Professor Quirrell deniability let him blame someone else for
    the False Memory Charm after the dust settled but
17662:
  text: |-
    But why would Professor Quirrell risk the fragile alliance Harry had with Draco
    via the attempted murder-frame
17663:
  text: |-
    (that Professor Quirrell had 'detected' and 'stopped' allegedly via a tracer put
    on Draco)
17664:
  text: |-
    Why would Professor Quirrell kill Hermione
17665:
  text: |-
    (if his first attempt to remove her hadn't worked)
17666:
  text: |-
    If Professor Quirrell was the bad guy then he might have lied about everything
    to do with horcruxes and maybe it wasn't coincidence at all that the only thing
    that could save his life was the avenue that could resurrect the Dark Lord what
    if the Dark Lord had arranged that too somehow
17667:
  text: |-
    (one day David Monroe had mysteriously disappeared, presumed dead at the Dark
    Lord's hands)
17668:
  text: |-
    An awful intuition had come over Harry, something separate from all the
    reasoning he'd done so far, an intuition that Harry couldn't put into words;
    except that he and the Defense Professor were very much alike in certain ways,
    and faking a Time-Turned message was just the sort of creative method that Harry
    himself might have tried to bypass all of a target's protections -
17669:
  text: |-
    And that was when Harry finally realized what should have been obvious from the
    very, very beginning.
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
17670:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell was smart.
17671:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell was smart in the same way as Harry.
17672:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell was smart in exactly the same way as Harry's mysterious dark
    side.
17673:
  text: |-
    If you had to guess when the Boy-Who-Lived had acquired his mysterious dark
    side, the obvious guess was the night of October 31st, 1981.
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
17674:
  text: |-
    And<br/> And<br/> And Professor Quirrell had known a password that Bellatrix
    Black had thought identified the Dark Lord and his presence gave the Boy-Who-
    Lived a sense of doom and his magic interacted destructively with Harry's and
    his favorite spell was Avada Kedavra and and and -
17675:
  text: |-
    The realization blasted through Harry like a vast dam breaking, releasing out
    all its water, bursting through his mind in an irresistible flood that swept
    everything away.
17676:
  text: |-
    There is only one reality that generates all of the observations.
17677:
  text: |-
    If different observations seem to point in incompatible directions, it means the
    true hypothesis is one you haven't thought of yet.
17678:
  text: |-
    And in those cases, when you finally think of the correct hypothesis, everything
    aligns behind it, beyond denial or horror, tearing away every doubt and every
    emotion that might stand in its path.
17679:
  text: |-
    - and then 'David Monroe' and 'Lord Voldemort' had just been one person playing
    both sides of the Wizarding War and that was why the Monroe family had been
    killed before they could meet 'David Monroe' just like Moody had suspected -
17680:
  text: |-
    Reality settled down into a single known state, one coherent state-of-affairs
    that compactly generated the observation set.
17681:
  text: |-
    Harry didn't jump, didn't change his breathing, tried not to show a single sign
    of the horror and agony flooding his mind.
17682:
  text: |-
    The Enemy was behind him, watching him.
17683:
  text: |-
    "All right," Harry said out loud, as soon as he dared trust his voice to sound
    normal. He kept on staring at the bodies, looking away from Professor Quirrell,
    because Harry didn't trust his own face. Harry lifted a sleeve to wipe away the
    sweat on his forehead, trying to make the gesture look casual; Harry couldn't
    control the sweat, or the rapid hammering in his chest. "Let's go get the
    Philosopher's Stone."
17684:
  text: |-
    All Harry needed was a single moment of distraction anywhere along the way to
    use his Time-Turner.
17685:
  text: |-
    There was no reply from behind him.
17686:
  text: |-
    The silence stretched.
17687:
  text: |-
    Slowly, Harry turned around.
17688:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell was standing upright and smiling.
17689:
  text: |-
    In the Defense Professor's hand was a shape of black metal pointed at Harry's
    wand arm, held with the sure grip of someone who knew exactly how to use a
    semiautomatic handgun.
