    Bright the sun, bright the air, bright the students and bright their parents,
    clean the paved ground of Platform 9.75, the winter Sun hanging low in the sky
    at 9:45AM in the morning on January 5th, 1992. Some of the younger students wore
    scarves and mittens, but most simply wore their robes; they were wizards, after
    all.
7147:
  text: |-
    After Harry had moved away from the landing platform, he took off his scarf and
    coat, opened a compartment of his trunk, and stowed away his winter things.
7148:
  text: |-
    For a long moment, he stood there letting the January air bite at him, just to
    see what it was like.
7149:
  text: |-
    Harry took out his wizards' robes, shrugged them on.
7150:
  text: |-
    And finally, Harry drew his wand; and he couldn't help thinking of the parents
    he'd only just kissed goodbye, of the world whose problems he was leaving
    behind...
7151:
  text: |-
    With a strange feeling of guilt for the unavoidable, Harry said,
    "<em>Thermos.</em>"
7152:
  text: |-
    The warmth flowed through him.
7153:
  text: |-
    And the Boy-Who-Lived was back.
7154:
  text: |-
    Harry yawned and stretched, feeling more lethargic than anything else at the
    conclusion of his vacation. He didn't feel like reading his textbooks, or even
    any serious science fiction, this morning; what he needed was something
    completely frivolous to occupy his attention...
7155:
  text: |-
    Well, that wouldn't be hard to come by, if he was willing to part with four
    Knuts.
7156:
  text: |-
    Besides, if the <em>Daily Prophet</em> was corrupt and the <em>Quibbler</em> was
    the only competing newspaper, there might be some suppressed real news in there.
7157:
  text: |-
    Harry trudged back over to the same newsstand from last time, wondering if the
    <em>Quibbler</em> could top the headline he'd seen before.
7158:
  text: |-
    The vendor started to smile as Harry approached, and then the man's face
    suddenly changed, as he caught sight of the scar.
7159:
  text: |-
    "<em>Harry Potter?</em>â€¯" gasped the vendor.
7160:
  text: |-
    "No, Mr. Durian," said Harry, eyes dipping briefly to the man's nametag, "just
    an amazing imitation -"
7161:
  text: |-
    And then Harry's voice stopped in his throat, as he caught sight of the top fold
    of the <em>Quibbler.</em>
7162:
  text: |-
    <em>SLOSHED SEER SPILLS SECRETS:<br/> DARK LORD TO RETURN,</em>
7163:
  text: |-
    For just an instant, Harry tried to clamp down on his face, before realizing
    that <em>not</em> being shocked could be just as revealing, in a sense -
7164:
  text: |-
    "Excuse me," Harry said. His voice sounded a little alarmed, and he didn't even
    know whether that was too revealing, or just what his normal reaction
    <em>would</em> be if he didn't know anything. He'd spent too much time around
    Slytherins, he was forgetting how to keep secrets from ordinary people. Four
    Knuts hit the counter. "One copy of the <em>Quibbler,</em> please."
7165:
  text: |-
    "Oh, no worries, Mr. Potter!" said the vendor hastily, waving his hands. "It's -
    never mind, just -"
7166:
  text: |-
    A newspaper flew through the air and hit Harry's fingers, and he unfolded it.
7167:
  text: |-
    <em>SLOSHED SEER SPILLS SECRETS:<br/> DARK LORD TO RETURN,<br/> WED DRACO
    MALFOY</em>
7168:
  text: |-
    "It's free," said the vendor, "for <em>you</em>, I mean -"
7169:
  text: |-
    "No," Harry said, "I was going to buy one anyway."
7170:
  text: |-
    The vendor took the coins, and Harry read on.
7171:
  text: |-
    "Gosh," Harry said half a minute later, "you get a seer smashed on six slugs of
    Scotch and she spills all <em>sorts</em> of secret stuff. I mean, who'd have
    thought that Sirius Black and Peter Pettigrew were secretly the same person?"
7172:
  text: |-
    "Not me," said the vendor.
7173:
  text: |-
    "They've even got a picture of the two of them together, so we know who it is
    that's secretly the same person."
7174:
  text: |-
    "Yup," said the vendor. "Pretty clever disguise, innit?"
7175:
  text: |-
    "And I'm secretly sixty-five years old."

        3 is true, more or less. It isn't explicitly true- just like how Peter and
        Sirius aren't <em>exactly</em> "the same person."
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Hermione Granger</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The trial</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Bellatrix Black</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Swore herself to Tom Riddle, and he presumably bound her to himself in many
        ways that are arguably closer than betrothal
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Luna Lovegood</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The deal with Draco.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Draco Malfoy</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        "Boy Who Lived Gets Draco Malfoy Pregnant" yadda yadda subtext. This is imo
        the weakest one, and kind of breaks the fourth wall, but it's funny
        nonetheless.
      </p>
7178:
  text: |-
    "Goin' ter be one interesting wedding," said the vendor.
7179:
  text: |-
    Harry looked up from the newspaper, and said in a pleasant voice, "You know, I
    heard at first that Luna Lovegood was insane, and I wondered if she really was,
    or if she was just making stuff up and giggling to herself the whole time. Then
    when I read my second <em>Quibbler</em> headline, I decided that she
    <em>couldn't</em> be insane, I mean, it can't be <em>easy</em> to make this
    stuff up, you couldn't do it by <em>accident</em>. And <em>now</em> do you know
    what I think? I think she must be mad after all. When ordinary people try to
    make stuff up, it doesn't come out like <em>this</em>. Something's got to go
    really <em>wrong</em> with the inside of your head before <em>this</em> is what
    comes out when you start making stuff up!"
7180:
  text: |-
    The vendor stared at Harry.
7181:
  text: |-
    "Seriously," said Harry. "Who <em>reads</em> this stuff?"
7182:
  text: |-
    "You," said the vendor.
7183:
  text: |-
    Harry wandered off to read his newspaper.
7184:
  text: |-
    He didn't sit at the same nearby table he'd sat down at with Draco, the
    <em>first</em> time he'd prepared to board this train. That seemed like tempting
    history to repeat itself.
7185:
  text: |-
    It wasn't <em>just</em> that his first week at Hogwarts had been, judging by the
    <em>Quibbler</em>, fifty-four years long. It was that, in Harry's humble
    opinion, his life did not <em>need</em> any new threads of complexity.
7186:
  text: |-
    So Harry found a small iron chair somewhere else, distant from the main crowd
    and the occasional muffled cracks of parents Apparating in with their children,
    and sat down and read the <em>Quibbler</em> to see if it contained any
    suppressed news.
7187:
  text: |-
    And besides the obvious craziness (heaven help them all if any of <em>that</em>
    was real) there was a good deal of snide romantic gossip; but nothing that would
    really be all that <em>important</em> if it was true.
7188:
  text: |-
    Harry was just reading about the Ministry's proposed marriage law, to ban all
    marriages, when -
7189:
  text: |-
    "Harry Potter," said a silken voice that sent a shock of adrenaline jolting
    through Harry's blood.
7190:
  text: |-
    Harry looked up.
7191:
  text: |-
    "Lucius Malfoy," Harry said, his voice weary. Next time he was going to do the
    smart thing, and wait outside in the Muggle part of King's Cross until 10:55am.
7192:
  text: |-
    Lucius inclined his head courteously, sending his long white hair drifting over
    his shoulders. The man was still carrying that same cane, lacquered in black
    with a silver snake's head for its handle; and something about his grip silently
    said <em>this is a weapon of deadly power,</em> not <em>I am feeble and leaning
    on this.</em> His face was expressionless.
7193:
  text: |-
    Two men flanked him, their eyes continuously scanning, their wands already
    gripped low in their hands. The two of them moved like a single organism with
    four legs and four arms, the senior Crabbe-and-Goyle, and Harry thought he could
    guess which was which, but then it didn't really matter. They were merely
    Lucius's appendages, as certainly as if they'd been the two rightmost toes on
    his left foot.
7194:
  text: |-
    "I apologize for disturbing you, Mr. Potter," said the smooth, silken voice.
    "But you have answered none of my owls; and this, I thought, might be my only
    opportunity to meet you."
7195:
  text: |-
    "I have received none of your owls," Harry said calmly. "Dumbledore intercepted
    them, I presume. But I would not have answered them if I had, except through
    Draco. For me to deal with you directly, without Draco's knowledge, would
    trespass on our friendship."
7196:
  text: |-
    <em>Please go away, please go away...</em>
7197:
  text: |-
    The grey eyes glittered at him. "Is that your pose, then..." said the senior
    Malfoy. "Well. I shall play along a little. What was your purpose in maneuvering
    your good friend, my son, into a public alliance with that girl?"
7198:
  text: |-
    "Oh," Harry said lightly, "that's obvious, right? Draco's working with Granger
    will make him realize that Muggleborns are human after all. Bwa. Ha. Ha."
7199:
  text: |-
    A thin trace of a smile moved over Lucius's lips. "Yes, that does sound like one
    of Dumbledore's plans. Which it is <em>not</em>."
7200:
  text: |-
    "Indeed," said Harry. "It is part of my game with Draco, and no work of
    Dumbledore's, and that is all I will say."
7201:
  text: |-
    "Let us dispense with games," said the senior Malfoy, the grey eyes suddenly
    hardening. "If my suspicions are true, you would hardly do Dumbledore's bidding
    in any case, <em>Mr. Potter.</em>"

      <p>Lucius starts out talking to Voldemort.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "Let us dispense with games," said the senior Malfoy, the grey eyes suddenly
          hardening. "If my suspicions are true, you would hardly do Dumbledore's
          bidding in any case, <em>Mr. Potter.</em>"
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>After which:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>There was a slight pause.</p>
        <p>
          "So you know," Harry said, his voice cold. "Tell me. At which point,
          exactly, did you realize?"
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        This of course is Harry bluffing his way through a conversation he doesn't
        understand. Given Lucius's prior belief, and the actual background truths
        leading Harry to use that particular tone of voice, this tactic works
        excellently.
      </p>
      <p>
        After some amount of conversation, Lucius suddenly hears Voldemort say the
        spectacularly out-of-character line:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "I find it interesting," Harry said, putting steel into his own voice, "that
          you think I could benefit from doing Draco harm. But it is irrelevant,
          Lucius. <em>He</em> is my friend, and I do not betray my friends."
        </p>
        <p>"<em>What?</em> " whispered Lucius. His face showed sheer shock.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        After some further events and interaction with Augusta Longbottom, Lucius
        hears the line:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "I think not. I prefer to deal with the part of House Malfoy that's my own
          age."
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        This line makes no sense for Voldemort having a cryptic conversation with
        Lucius; it only makes sense for "Harry Potter". Which causes Lucius to
        suddenly realize that this whole time he's been talking to a Voldemort
        <em>staying in character</em> as Harry Potter, not giving away or admitting
        anything; a Voldemort who is therefore <em>pretending</em> to be Harry Potter
        fishing for information while bluffing his way through a conversation he
        doesn't understand.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "Of course..." said Lucius slowly. "I do feel the fool now. This whole time
          you were just pretending to have no idea what we were talking about."
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        In actuality, of course, Lucius is dealing with Harry Potter fishing for
        information while bluffing his way through a conversation he doesn't
        understand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sheesh, why would anyone have trouble keeping track of this, it's not more
        than 3 levels of recursion.
      </p>
7202:
  text: |-
    There was a slight pause.
7203:
  text: |-
    "So you know," Harry said, his voice cold. "Tell me. At which point, exactly,
    did you realize?"
7204:
  text: |-
    "When I read your response to Professor Quirrell's little speech," said the
    white-haired man, and chuckled grimly. "I was puzzled, at first, for it seemed
    not in your own interest; it took me days to understand whose interest was being
    served, and then it all finally became clear. And it is also obvious that you
    are weak, in some ways if not others."
7205:
  text: |-
    "Very clever of you," said Harry, still cold. "But perhaps you mistake my
    interests."
7206:
  text: |-
    "Perhaps I do." A hint of steel came into the silken voice. "Indeed, that is
    precisely what I fear. You are playing strange games with my son, to a purpose I
    cannot guess. That is not a friendly act, and you cannot but <em>expect</em> me
    to be concerned!"
7207:
  text: |-
    Lucius was leaning upon his cane with both hands now, and both those hands
    white, and his bodyguards had suddenly tensed.
7208:
  text: |-
    Some instinct within Harry claimed that it would be a very bad idea to show his
    fear, to let Lucius see that he could be intimidated. They were in a public
    train station anyway -
7209:
  text: |-
    "I find it interesting," Harry said, putting steel into his own voice, "that you
    think I could benefit from doing Draco harm. But it is irrelevant, Lucius.
    <em>He</em> is my friend, and I do not betray my friends."
7210:
  text: |-
    "<em>What?</em>â€¯" whispered Lucius. His face showed sheer shock.
7211:
  text: |-
    Then -
7212:
  text: |-
    "Company," said one of the minions, and Harry thought, from the voice, that it
    must be the senior Crabbe.
7213:
  text: |-
    Lucius straightened and turned, then let out a hiss of disapproval.
7214:
  text: |-
    Neville was approaching, looking scared but determined, in tow behind a tall
    woman who didn't look scared at all.
7215:
  text: |-
    "Madam Longbottom," Lucius said icily.
7216:
  text: |-
    "Mr. Malfoy," returned the woman with equal ice. "Are you being an annoyance to
    our Harry Potter?"
7217:
  text: |-
    The bark of laughter that came from Lucius seemed strangely bitter. "Oh, I
    rather think not. Come to protect him from me, have you?" The white-haired head
    shifted toward Neville. "And this would be Mr. Potter's loyal lieutenant, the
    last scion of Longbottom, Neville, self-styled of Chaos. How strangely does the
    world turn. Sometimes I think it must all be mad."
7218:
  text: |-
    Harry had no idea at all what to say to that, and Neville looked confused, and
    frightened.
7219:
  text: |-
    "I doubt it is the world that is mad," said Madam Longbottom. Her voice took on
    a gloating tone. "You seem in a poor mood, Mr. Malfoy. Did the speech of our
    dear Professor Quirrell cost you a few allies?"
7220:
  text: |-
    "It was a clever enough slander of my abilities," Lucius said coldly, "though
    only effective upon the fools who believe that I was truly a Death Eater."
7221:
  text: |-
    "<em>What?</em>â€¯" blurted Neville.
7222:
  text: |-
    "I was under the <em>Imperius,</em> young man," said Lucius, now sounding tired.
    "The Dark Lord could hardly have begun recruiting among pureblood families
    without the support of House Malfoy. I demurred, and he simply made sure of me.
    His own Death Eaters did not know it until afterward, hence the false Mark I
    bear; though since I did not truly consent, it does not bind me. Some of the
    Death Eaters still believe I was foremost among their number, and for the peace
    of this nation I let them believe it, to keep them controlled. But I was not
    such a fool as to support that ill-fated adventurer of my own choice -"
7223:
  text: |-
    "Ignore him," Madam Longbottom said, the instruction addressed to Harry as well
    as Neville. "He must spend the rest of his life pretending, for fear of your
    testimony under Veritaserum." Said with malicious satisfaction.
7224:
  text: |-
    Lucius turned his back on her dismissively, and faced Harry again. "Will you
    request this harridan to depart, <em>Mr. Potter?</em>â€¯"
7225:
  text: |-
    "I think not," said Harry in a dry voice. "I prefer to deal with the part of
    House Malfoy that's my own age."
7226:
  text: |-
    There was a long pause, then. The grey eyes searched him.
7227:
  text: |-
    "Of course..." said Lucius slowly. "I <em>do</em> feel the fool now. This whole
    time you were just pretending to have no idea what we were talking about."
7228:
  text: |-
    Harry met the gaze, and said nothing.
7229:
  text: |-
    Lucius raised his cane a few centimeters and struck it hard on the ground.
7230:
  text: |-
    The world vanished in a pale haze, all sounds went quiet, there was nothing in
    the universe but Harry and Lucius Malfoy and the snake-headed cane.
7231:
  text: |-
    "My son is my heart," said the senior Malfoy, "the last worthwhile thing I have
    left in this world, and this I say to you in a spirit of friendship: if he were
    to come to harm, I would give my life over to vengeance. But so long as my son
    does <em>not</em> come to harm, I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors.
    And as you have asked nothing more of me, I will ask nothing more of you."
7232:
  text: |-
    Then the pale haze vanished, showing an outraged Madam Longbottom being blocked
    from moving forward by the senior Crabbe; her wand was in her hand, now.
7233:
  text: |-
    "How <em>dare</em> you!" she hissed.
7234:
  text: |-
    Lucius's dark robes swirled around him, and his white hair, as he turned to the
    senior Goyle. "We return to Malfoy Manor."
7235:
  text: |-
    There were three pops of Apparition, and they were gone.
7236:
  text: |-
    A silence followed.
7237:
  text: |-
    "Dear <em>heavens</em>," said Madam Longbottom. "What was that about?"
7238:
  text: |-
    Harry shrugged helplessly. Then he looked at Neville.
7239:
  text: |-
    There was sweat on Neville's forehead.
7240:
  text: |-
    "Thank you very much, Neville," said Harry. "Your help was greatly appreciated,
    Neville. And now, Neville, I think you should sit down."
7241:
  text: |-
    "Yes, General," said Neville, and instead of coming over to one of the other
    chairs near Harry, he semi-collapsed into a sitting position on the pavement.
7242:
  text: |-
    "You have wrought many changes in my grandson," said Madam Longbottom. "I
    approve of some, but not others."
7243:
  text: |-
    "Send me the list of which is which," said Harry. "I'll see what I can do."
7244:
  text: |-
    Neville groaned, but said nothing.
7245:
  text: |-
    Madam Longbottom gave a chuckle. "I shall, young man, thank you." Her voice
    lowered. "Mr. Potter... the speech given by Professor Quirrell is something our
    nation has long needed to hear. I cannot say as much of your comment on it."
7246:
  text: |-
    "I will take your opinion under advisement," Harry said mildly.
7247:
  text: |-
    "I dearly hope that you do," said Madam Longbottom, and turned back to her
    grandson. "Do I still need to -"
7248:
  text: |-
    "It's okay for you to go, Granma," said Neville. "I'll be fine on my own, this
    time."
7249:
  text: |-
    "Now <em>that</em> I approve of," she said, and popped and vanished like a soap
    bubble.
7250:
  text: |-
    The two boys sat quietly for a moment.
7251:
  text: |-
    Neville spoke first, his voice weary. "You're going to try to fix all the
    changes she <em>approves</em> of, right?"
7252:
  text: |-
    "Not <em>all</em> of them," Harry said innocently. "I just want to make sure I'm
    not corrupting you."
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
7253:
  text: |-
    Draco looked <em>very</em> worried. His head kept darting around, despite the
    fact that Draco had insisted on them going down into Harry's trunk, and using a
    true Quieting Charm and not just the sound-blurring barrier.
7254:
  text: |-
    "<em>What</em> did you say to Father?" blurted Draco, the moment the Quieting
    Charm went up and the sounds of Platform 9 3/4 vanished.

    "I... look, can you tell me what he said to <em>you,</em> before he dropped you
    off?" said Harry.

    "That I should tell him right away if you seemed to be threatening me," said
    Draco. "That I should tell him right away if there was anything <em>I</em> was
    doing that could pose a threat to <em>you!</em> Father thinks you're
    <em>dangerous,</em> Harry, whatever you said to him today it <em>scared</em>
    him! <em>It's not a good idea to scare Father!</em>â€¯"

    "<em>What</em> did you talk about?" demanded Draco.

    Harry leaned back wearily in the small folding chair that sat at the bottom of
    his trunk's cavern. "You know, Draco, just as the fundamental question of
    rationality is 'What do I think I know and how do I think I know it?', there's
    also a cardinal sin, a way of thinking that's the opposite of that. Like the
    ancient Greek philosophers. They had no clue what was going on, so they'd go
    around saying things like 'All is water' or 'All is fire', and they never asked
    themselves, 'Wait a minute, even if everything <em>is</em> water, how could I
    possibly <em>know</em> that?' They didn't ask themselves if they had evidence
    which discriminated <em>that</em> possibility from all the <em>other</em>
    possibilities you could imagine, evidence they'd be very unlikely to encounter
    if the theory <em>wasn't</em> true -"

    "<em>Harry</em>," Draco said, his voice strained, "<em>What did you talk about
    with Father?</em>â€¯"

    "I don't know, actually," said Harry, "so it's very important that I
    <em>not</em> just make stuff up -"

    Harry had never heard Draco shriek in horror in quite that high a pitch before.
