    Unfortunately, no one can be told who J. K. Rowling is. You have to see her for
    yourself.

    Science disclaimers: Luosha points out that the theory of empathy in Ch. 27 (you
    use your own brain to simulate others) isn't quite a known scientific fact. The
    evidence so far points in that direction, but we haven't analyzed the brain
    circuitry and proven it. Similarly, timeless formulations of quantum mechanics
    (alluded to in Ch. 28) are so elegant that I'd be shocked to find the final
    theory had time in it, but they're not established yet either.

    There'd been a sinking feeling in Hermione's stomach lately, every time she
    heard the other students talking about her and Harry. She'd been in a shower
    stall this morning when she'd overheard a conversation between Morag and Padma
    that had been the last straw piled on top of quite a lot of other straws.
5810:
  text: |-
    She was starting to think that getting involved in a rivalry with Harry Potter
    had been a terrible mistake.
5811:
  text: |-
    If she'd just <em>stayed away</em> from Harry Potter, she could have been
    Hermione Granger, the brightest academic star of Hogwarts, who was earning more
    points for Ravenclaw than anyone. She wouldn't have been <em>as</em> famous as
    the Boy-Who-Lived, but she would have been famous for <em>herself</em>.
5812:
  text: |-
    Instead the Boy-Who-Lived had an academic rival, and her name happened to be
    Hermione Granger.
5813:
  text: |-
    And worse, she had gone on a date with him.
5814:
  text: |-
    The idea of getting into a Romance with Harry had seemed like an appealing idea
    at first. She'd read books like that, and if there was anyone in Hogwarts who
    was a candidate for the heroine's love interest it was obviously Harry Potter.
    Bright, funny, famous, sometimes scary...
5815:
  text: |-
    So she'd forced Harry into going on a date with her.
5816:
  text: |-
    And now <em>she</em> was <em>his</em> love interest.
5817:
  text: |-
    Or worse, one of the options on his dinner menu.
5818:
  text: |-
    She'd been in a shower stall that morning and just about to turn on the water,
    when she'd heard giggles coming from outside. And she'd heard Morag talking
    about how that Muggleborn girl probably wouldn't fight hard enough to win
    against Ginevra Weasley, and Padma speculating that Harry Potter might decide he
    wanted <em>both</em>.
5819:
  text: |-
    It was like they didn't understand that GIRLS had options on their dinner menu
    and BOYS fought over them.
5820:
  text: |-
    But that wasn't even the part that hurt, really. It was that when she scored 98
    on one of Professor McGonagall's tests, the news wasn't that Hermione Granger
    had scored the highest in the class, the news was that Harry Potter's rival had
    scored seven more points than him.
5821:
  text: |-
    If you got too close to the Boy-Who-Lived, you became part of his story.
5822:
  text: |-
    You didn't get your own.
5823:
  text: |-
    And the thought had come to Hermione that she should just walk away, but that
    would've been too sad.
5824:
  text: |-
    But she did want to get <em>back</em> what she'd accidentally given away by
    letting herself become known as Harry's rival. She wanted to be a separate
    person again instead of Harry Potter's third leg, was that too much to ask?
5825:
  text: |-
    It was a hard trap to climb out of once you fell in. No matter how high you
    scored in class, even if you did something that deserved a special dinnertime
    announcement, it just meant you were rivaling Harry Potter again.
5826:
  text: |-
    But she thought she'd come up with a way.
5827:
  text: |-
    Something to do that <em>wouldn't</em> be seen as pushing up on the opposite end
    of Harry Potter's seesaw.
5828:
  text: |-
    It would be hard.
5829:
  text: |-
    It would go against her nature.
5830:
  text: |-
    She would have to fight someone very evil.
5831:
  text: |-
    And she would need to ask someone even <em>more</em> evil for help.
5832:
  text: |-
    Hermione raised her hand to knock upon that terrible door.
5833:
  text: |-
    She hesitated.
5834:
  text: |-
    Hermione realized she was being <em>silly</em>, and raised her hand a bit
    higher.
5835:
  text: |-
    She tried to knock again.
5836:
  text: |-
    Her hand quite failed to touch the door.
5837:
  text: |-
    And then the door swung open anyway.
5838:
  text: |-
    "Dear me," said the spider, sitting in its web. "Was it really that hard to lose
    a single Quirrell point, Miss Granger?"
5839:
  text: |-
    Hermione stood there with her hand raised, her cheeks growing pink. It
    <em>had</em> been.
5840:
  text: |-
    "Well, Miss Granger, I shall be merciful," said the evil Professor Quirrell.
    "Consider it already lost. There, I have taken a hard choice from you. Are you
    not grateful?"
5841:
  text: |-
    "Professor Quirrell," Hermione managed to say in a voice that squeaked a little.
    "I have a lot of Quirrell points, don't I?"
5842:
  text: |-
    "You do indeed," said Professor Quirrell. "Though one less than you had before.
    Terrible, isn't it? Just think, if I don't like your reason for coming here, you
    could lose another fifty. Maybe I'd take them away one... by one... by one..."
5843:
  text: |-
    Hermione's cheeks were going even redder. "You're really evil, did anyone ever
    tell you that?"
5844:
  text: |-
    "Miss Granger," Professor Quirrell said gravely, "it can be dangerous to give
    people compliments like that when they have not been truly earned. The recipient
    might feel bashful and undeserving and want to do something worthy of your
    praise. Now what was it you wanted to talk to me about, Miss Granger?"

    It was after lunch on Thursday afternoon, and Hermione and Harry were ensconced
    in a little library nook, with a <em>Quietus</em> field up so they could talk.
    Harry was lying stomach-down on the ground with his elbows resting on the floor
    and his head in his hands and his feet kicking up casually behind him. Hermione
    was occupying a stuffed chair much too large for her, like she was the Hermione
    center of a candy shell.
5846:
  text: |-
    Harry had suggested that they could, as a first pass, read just the
    <em>titles</em> of all the books in the library, and then Hermione could read
    all the tables of contents.
5847:
  text: |-
    Hermione had thought this was a brilliant idea. She'd never done that with a
    library before.
5848:
  text: |-
    Unfortunately there was a slight flaw in this plan.
5849:
  text: |-
    Namely, they were both Ravenclaws.
5850:
  text: |-
    Hermione was reading a book called <em>Magical Mnemonics.</em><em><br/></em>
5851:
  text: |-
    Harry was reading a book called <em>The Skeptical Wizard.</em><em><br/></em>
5852:
  text: |-
    Each had thought it was just one special exception they would make only this one
    time, and neither had yet realized it was impossible for either of them to ever
    finish reading all the book titles no matter how hard they tried.
5853:
  text: |-
    The quiet of their little nook was broken by two words.
5854:
  text: |-
    "Oh, <em>no</em>," Harry suddenly said out loud, sounding like the words had
    been torn out of him.
5855:
  text: |-
    There was a bit more quiet.
5856:
  text: |-
    "He <em>didn't</em>," Harry said, in the same voice.
5857:
  text: |-
    Then she heard Harry start giggling helplessly.
5858:
  text: |-
    Hermione looked up from her book.
5859:
  text: |-
    "All right," she said, "what <em>is</em> it?"
5860:
  text: |-
    "I just found out why you never ask the Weasleys about the family rat," Harry
    said. "It's <em>really</em> awful and I shouldn't be laughing and I'm a terrible
    person."
5861:
  text: |-
    "Yes," Hermione said primly, "you are. Tell me too."
5862:
  text: |-
    "Okay, first the background. There's a whole chapter in this book about Sirius
    Black conspiracy theories. You remember who that is, right?"
5863:
  text: |-
    "Of course," said Hermione. Sirius Black was a traitor, a friend of James Potter
    who had let Voldemort into the protected home of the Potters.
5864:
  text: |-
    "So it turns out there were a number of, shall we say, <em>irregularities</em>,
    associated with Black going to Azkaban. He didn't get a trial, and the Junior
    Minister in charge when the Aurors arrested Black was none other than Cornelius
    Fudge, who became our current Minister of Magic."
5865:
  text: |-
    That sounded a little suspicious to Hermione too, and she said as much.
5866:
  text: |-
    Harry made a shrugging motion with his shoulders, as he lay on the floor looking
    at his book. "Suspicious things happen all the time, and if you're a conspiracy
    theorist you can always find <em>something</em>."
5867:
  text: |-
    "But <em>no trial?</em>â€¯" said Hermione.
5868:
  text: |-
    "It was right after the Dark Lord's defeat," Harry said, his voice serious as he
    said it. "Things were incredibly chaotic, and when the Aurors tracked down Black
    he was standing there laughing in a street ankle-deep in blood, with twenty
    eyewitnesses to recount how he'd killed a friend of my father's named Peter
    Pettigrew plus twelve bystanders. I'm not saying I approve of Black not getting
    a trial. But these are wizards we're talking about here, so it's not really any
    more suspicious than, I don't know, the sort of thing people point to when they
    want to argue over who shot John F. Kennedy. So anyway, Sirius Black is the
    wizarding Lee Harvey Oswald. There's all sorts of conspiracy theories about who
    <em>really</em> betrayed my parents instead of him, and one of the favorites is
    Peter Pettigrew, and this is where it starts getting complicated."
5869:
  text: |-
    Hermione listened, fascinated. "But how do you go from there to the Weasleys'
    <em>pet rat</em> -"
5870:
  text: |-
    "Hold on," said Harry, "I'm getting there. Now, after Pettigrew's death it came
    out that he'd been a spy for the Light - not a double agent, just someone who
    snuck around and found things out. He'd been good at that since he was a
    teenager, even in Hogwarts he had a reputation for finding out all sorts of
    secrets. So the conspiracy theory is that Pettigrew became an unregistered
    Animagus while he was still in Hogwarts, an Animagus of something small that
    could scurry around and listen to conversations. The main problem being that
    successful Animagi are rare and doing it as a teenager would be really unlikely,
    so of course the conspiracy theory says that my father and Black were
    unregistered Animagi too. And in that conspiracy theory, Pettigrew himself
    killed the twelve bystanders, turned into his small Animagus form, and ran. So
    Michael Shermer says there are four additional problems with this. One, Black
    was the only one besides my parents who knew how to get through the wards around
    their house." (Harry's voice was a little hard as he said that.) "Two, Black was
    a more likely suspect to start with than Pettigrew, there's a rumor Black
    deliberately tried to get a student killed during his time at Hogwarts, and he
    was from this really nasty pureblood family, Bellatrix Black was literally his
    cousin. Three, Black was twenty times the fighting wizard that Pettigrew was,
    even if he wasn't as smart. The duel between them would have been like Professor
    Quirrell versus Professor Sprout. Pettigrew probably didn't even get a chance to
    draw his wand, let alone fake all the evidence the conspiracy theory requires.
    And four, Black was standing in the street <em>laughing.</em>"
5871:
  text: |-
    "But the <em>rat</em> -" said Hermione.
5872:
  text: |-
    "Right," Harry said. "Well, to make a long story short, Bill Weasley decided
    that his little brother Percy's pet rat was Pettigrew's Animagus form -"
5873:
  text: |-
    Hermione's jaw dropped.
5874:
  text: |-
    "Yes," Harry said, "you wouldn't exactly expect Evil Pettigrew to be living a
    sad and furtive life as the pet rat of an enemy wizarding family, he'd either be
    with the Malfoys or, more likely, off in the Carribean after a bit of plastic
    surgery. Anyway, Bill knocks out his little brother Percy, stuns and grabs the
    rat, sends out all these emergency owl messages -"
5875:
  text: |-
    "Oh, <em>no!</em>â€¯" Hermione said, the words torn out of her.
5876:
  text: |-
    "- and somehow manages to gather Dumbledore, the Minister of Magic, and the Head
    Auror -"
5877:
  text: |-
    "He <em>didn't!</em>â€¯" said Hermione.
5878:
  text: |-
    "And of course when they get there they think he's crazy, but they use
    <em>Veritas Oculum</em> on the rat anyway, just to be sure, and what do they
    discover?"
5879:
  text: |-
    She would've <em>died</em>. "A rat."
5880:
  text: |-
    "You win a cookie! So they dragged poor Bill Weasley off to St. Mungo's and it
    turned out to be a pretty standard schizophrenic break, it just happens to some
    people, especially young men around what we'd consider college age. Guy was
    convinced he was ninety-seven years old and had died and gone back in time to
    his younger self via train station. And he responded perfectly well to
    antipsychotics and is back to normal and everything's fine now, except people
    don't talk as much anymore about Sirius Black conspiracy theories, and you don't
    ever ask the Weasleys about the family rat."
5881:
  text: |-
    Hermione was giggling helplessly. It was really awful and she shouldn't be
    laughing and she was a terrible person.
5882:
  text: |-
    "The thing I <em>don't</em> understand," Harry said, after their giggles had
    died down, "is <em>why</em> Black would hunt down Pettigrew instead of running
    as fast as he could. He had to know the Aurors would be after him. I wonder if
    they got the reason out of Black before they took him to Azkaban? See, this is
    why people who are absolutely positively guilty still go through the legal
    system and get trials."
5883:
  text: |-
    Hermione had to agree with that.
5884:
  text: |-
    Soon Harry was done with his book while Hermione was only halfway through hers -
    hers was a much more difficult book than Harry's, but she still felt embarrassed
    about that. And then she had to put <em>Magical Mnemonics</em> back on the shelf
    and drag herself away, because it was time for her to face the most dreaded
    class in Hogwarts, BROOMSTICK RIDING.
5885:
  text: |-
    Harry tagged along as she walked there, even though his own class wasn't until
    an hour and a half later, like a fighter jet escorting a sad little propeller
    plane on its way to its own funeral.
5886:
  text: |-
    The boy wished her goodbye in a quiet, sympathetic voice, and she walked onto
    the grassy fields of Doom.
5887:
  text: |-
    And there was much shrieking and almost falling and horrible brushes with death
    and the ground in completely the <em>wrong place</em> and the sun getting in her
    eyes and Morag buzzing her and Mandy thinking she was being <em>subtle</em>
    about always being near enough to catch her if she fell and she <em>knew</em>
    the other students were laughing at both of them but she never said anything to
    Mandy because she didn't actually want to die.
5888:
  text: |-
    After ten million years the class ended, and she was back on the ground where
    she belonged until next Thursday. Sometimes she had nightmares about it always
    being Thursday.
5889:
  text: |-
    <em>Why</em> everyone had to learn this, when they were just going to Apparate
    or Floo or portkey everywhere once they grew up, was a complete and utter
    mystery to Hermione. Nobody actually needed to ride broomsticks as an adult, it
    was like being forced to play dodgeball in P.E.
5890:
  text: |-
    At least Harry had the decency to be ashamed of being good at it.
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
5891:
  text: |-
    It was a couple of hours later, and she was in a Hufflepuff study hall with
    Hannah, Susan, Leanne, and Megan. Professor Flitwick, surprisingly diffident for
    a teacher, had asked if she might possibly maybe help those four with their
    Charms homework for a while, even though they weren't Ravenclaws, and Hermione
    had felt so proud she'd almost <em>burst</em>.
5892:
  text: |-
    Hermione took a piece of parchment, spilled a little bit of ink on it, tore it
    into four pieces, crumpled them, and tossed the pieces on the table.
5893:
  text: |-
    <em>She</em> could have gotten it just from crumpling it, but doing all that
    made it more like garbage, and that helped when someone was first practicing the
    Disposal Charm.
5894:
  text: |-
    Hermione sharpened her ears and eyes, and said, "Okay, try it."
5895:
  text: |-
    "<em>Everto.</em>"
5896:
  text: |-
    "<em>Everto.</em>"
5897:
  text: |-
    "<em>Everto.</em>"
5898:
  text: |-
    "<em>Everto.</em>"
5899:
  text: |-
    Hermione didn't think she'd quite caught all the problems. "Can you all try it
    again?"
5900:
  text: |-
    An hour later Hermione had concluded that (1), Leanne and Megan were sort of
    sloppy, but if you asked them to keep practicing something, they would, (2)
    Hannah and Susan were focused and driven to the point where you had to keep
    telling them to <em>slow down</em> and <em>relax</em> and <em>think</em> about
    things instead of <em>trying</em> so hard - it was odd to think that those two
    would soon be <em>hers</em> - and (3) she liked helping Hufflepuffs, the whole
    study hall had a very cheerful atmosphere.
5901:
  text: |-
    When she left for dinner, she found the Boy-Who-Lived reading a book while he
    waited to escort her. It made her feel flattered, and also a little worried
    because Harry didn't seem to really talk to <em>anyone</em> besides her.
5902:
  text: |-
    "Did you know there's a girl in Hufflepuff who's a Metamorphmagus?" said
    Hermione as they headed toward the Great Hall. "She makes her hair really red,
    like stopsign red not Weasley red, and when she spilled hot tea on herself she
    turned into a black-haired boy until she got it under control again."
5903:
  text: |-
    "Really? Cool," said Harry, sounding a bit distracted. "Um, Hermione, just to
    check, you know tomorrow is the last day to sign up for Professor Quirrell's
    armies, right?"
5904:
  text: |-
    "Yes," Hermione said. "The armies of the evil Professor Quirrell." Her voice was
    a little angry, though Harry didn't know why, of course.
5905:
  text: |-
    "Hermione," Harry said, his voice exasperated, "he's not evil. He's a little bit
    Dark and a whole lot Slytherin. It's not the same as being <em>evil</em>."
5906:
  text: |-
    Harry Potter had too many words for things, that was his problem. He would have
    been better off if he'd just divided the universe into Good and Bad. "Professor
    Quirrell called me up in front of the whole class and told me to <em>shoot
    someone!</em>â€¯"
5907:
  text: |-
    "He was right," Harry said, his face sober. "I'm sorry, Hermione, but he was.
    You should have shot <em>me,</em> I wouldn't have minded. You can't learn Battle
    Magic if you can't practice against real opponents using real spells. And now
    you're doing okay in sparring, aren't you?"
5908:
  text: |-
    Hermione was only twelve, and so she knew, but she couldn't put it into words,
    she couldn't find the thing to say that would convince Harry.
5909:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell had taken a young girl and called up that girl in front of
    everyone, and ordered her to open fire without provocation on a classmate.
5910:
  text: |-
    It didn't <em>matter</em> if Professor Quirrell was right about her needing to
    learn it.
5911:
  text: |-
    Professor McGonagall wouldn't ever have done that.
5912:
  text: |-
    Professor Flitwick wouldn't ever have done that.
5913:
  text: |-
    Maybe not even Professor Snape would have done that.
5914:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell was <em>EVIL</em>.
5915:
  text: |-
    But she couldn't find the words, and she knew that Harry would never believe
    her.
5916:
  text: |-
    "Hermione, I've talked to older students," Harry said. "Professor Quirrell could
    be the <em>only</em> competent Defense Professor we get in all seven years at
    Hogwarts. Anything else we can learn later. If we want to study Defense, we have
    to do it <em>this year.</em> The students who sign up for the extracurricular
    stuff are going to be learning huge amounts, way beyond what the Ministry thinks
    first-years are supposed to study - did you know we're going to be learning the
    Patronus Charm? In <em>January?</em>â€¯"
5917:
  text: |-
    "The <em>Patronus Charm?</em>â€¯" Hermione said, her voice going up in surprise.
5918:
  text: |-
    Her books said that was one of the brightest magics known, a weapon against the
    Darkest creatures, cast with pure positive emotions. It wasn't something she'd
    expect the evil Professor Quirrell to teach - or arrange to be taught, since
    Hermione couldn't imagine he could do the spell himself.
5919:
  text: |-
    "Yes," Harry said. "Students don't usually learn the Patronus Charm until their
    fifth years or even later! But Professor Quirrell says the Ministry schedules
    were made up by talking Flobberworms, and the ability to cast the Patronus Charm
    depends on emotions more than magical strength. Professor Quirrell says that he
    thinks most students do <em>way</em> less than they can, and this year he's
    going to prove it."
5920:
  text: |-
    There was the usual tone of awed worship that Harry's voice had when he talked
    about Professor Quirrell, and Hermione gritted her teeth and kept walking.
5921:
  text: |-
    "I already signed up, actually," Hermione said, her voice a little quiet. "I did
    it this morning. For everything, just like you said."
5922:
  text: |-
    <em>In for a penny, in for a pound</em> was the usual expression.
5923:
  text: |-
    Besides, she didn't want to <em>lose</em>, and if she wanted to win she had to
    learn.
5924:
  text: |-
    "So you <em>will</em> be in the armies, then?" Harry's voice was suddenly
    enthusiastic. "That's awesome, Hermione! I've already gotten my list of
    soldiers, but I'm sure Professor Quirrell will let me add one more, or trade -"
5925:
  text: |-
    "I'm not joining <em>your</em> army." Hermione's voice was sharp. She knew it
    was a reasonable assumption but it <em>still</em> annoyed her.
5926:
  text: |-
    Harry blinked. "Not Draco Malfoy's, surely. So you want to be in the third army?
    Even though we don't know who the general <em>is</em> yet?" Harry sounded
    surprised and a little wounded, and she couldn't blame him, though of course she
    did blame him, since in fact it was all his fault. "But why not mine?"
5927:
  text: |-
    "Think about it," Hermione snapped, "and maybe you'll work it out!"
5928:
  text: |-
    And she sped up her stride and left Harry gaping behind her.
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
5929:
  text: |-
    "Professor Quirrell," Draco said in his most formal voice, "I must protest your
    appointment of Hermione Granger as the third general."
5930:
  text: |-
    "Oh?" said Professor Quirrell, leaning back in his chair in a casual and relaxed
    manner. "Protest away, Mr. Malfoy."
5931:
  text: |-
    "Granger is unfit for the position," said Draco.
5932:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell tapped a finger on his cheek thoughtfully. "Why yes, yes she
    is. Do you have any further protests?"
5933:
  text: |-
    "Professor Quirrell," said Harry Potter beside him, "with all due respect to
    Miss Granger's many outstanding academic talents and the Quirrell points she has
    justly earned in your classes, her personality is not suited to military
    command."
5934:
  text: |-
    Draco had been relieved when Harry had agreed to accompany him to Professor
    Quirrell's office. It wasn't <em>just</em> that Harry was a gigantic blatant
    teacher's pet where Professor Quirrell was concerned. Draco had also started to
    worry that Harry actually <em>was</em> friends with Granger, it had been a while
    now and he <em>still</em> hadn't made his move... but this was more like it.
5935:
  text: |-
    "I agree with Mr. Potter," said Draco. "Appointing her as a general turns it
    into a farce."
5936:
  text: |-
    "Harshly put," said Harry, "but I cannot bring myself to disagree with Mr.
    Malfoy. To be blunt, Professor Quirrell, Hermione Granger has around as much
    intent to kill as a bowl of wet grapes."
5937:
  text: |-
    "That," said Professor Quirrell mildly, "is not a thing I would fail to notice
    myself. You are telling me nothing I do not already know."
5938:
  text: |-
    It was Draco's turn to say something, but the conversation had suddenly
    hiccupped. That answer had <em>not</em> been in the possibilities he and Harry
    had brainstormed before coming here. What <em>did</em> you say after the teacher
    said that he knew everything you knew and he was still going to commit an
    obvious mistake?
5939:
  text: |-
    The silence stretched.
5940:
  text: |-
    "Is this some sort of plot?" Harry said slowly.
5941:
  text: |-
    "Must everything I do be some sort of plot?" said Professor Quirrell. "Can't I
    ever create chaos just for the sake of chaos?"
5942:
  text: |-
    Draco almost choked.
5943:
  text: |-
    "Not in your Battle Magic class," Harry said with calm certainty. "Other places,
    maybe, but not there."
5944:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell slowly raised his eyebrows.
5945:
  text: |-
    Harry gazed steadily back at him.
5946:
  text: |-
    Draco shivered.
5947:
  text: |-
    "Well then," Professor Quirrell said. "Neither of you seem to have considered a
    very simple question. Who could I appoint instead of Miss Granger?"
5948:
  text: |-
    "Blaise Zabini," Draco said without hesitation.
5949:
  text: |-
    "Any other suggestions?" said Professor Quirrell, sounding quite amused.
5950:
  text: |-
    <em>Anthony Goldstein and Ernie Macmillan,</em> came the thought, before Draco's
    common sense kicked in and ruled out mudbloods and Hufflepuffs no matter how
    aggressively they dueled. So instead Draco just said, "What's wrong with
    Zabini?"
5951:
  text: |-
    "I <em>see</em>..." Harry said slowly.
5952:
  text: |-
    "I <em>don't,</em>" said Draco. "Why not Zabini?"
5953:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell looked at Draco. "Because, Mr. Malfoy, no matter how hard he
    tries, he'll never be able to keep up with you or Mr. Potter."
5954:
  text: |-
    The shock of it staggered Draco. "You can't believe <em>Granger</em> is going to
    -"
5955:
  text: |-
    "He's gambling on her," Harry said quietly. "It's not guaranteed. The odds
    aren't even good. She'll probably never give us a good fight, and even if she
    does, it may take her months to learn. But she's the only one in our year with
    any chance at all of growing to beat us."
5956:
  text: |-
    Draco's hands twitched but didn't clench into fists. Showing up as your
    supporter and then backing out was a classic undermining tactic, so Harry Potter
    <em>was</em> in it with Granger and <em>that</em> implied -
5957:
  text: |-
    "But Professor," Harry went on smoothly, "I'm worried Hermione will be
    <em>miserable</em> as the general of an army. I'm speaking as her friend now,
    Professor Quirrell. The competition might be good for Draco and me, but what
    you're asking her to do isn't good for <em>her!</em>â€¯"
5958:
  text: |-
    Never mind.
5959:
  text: |-
    "Your friendship for Hermione Granger does you credit," Professor Quirrell said
    dryly. "Especially as you are able to be friends with Draco Malfoy at the same
    time. Quite a feat, that."
5960:
  text: |-
    Harry suddenly looked a little nervous, meaning he probably felt a lot
    <em>more</em> nervous, and Draco silently swore to himself. Of course Harry
    wasn't going to fool Professor Quirrell.
5961:
  text: |-
    "And I doubt Miss Granger would appreciate your friendly concern," said
    Professor Quirrell. "She asked me for the position, Mr. Potter, I did not ask
    her."
5962:
  text: |-
    Harry was quiet at this for a moment. Then he flashed Draco a quick look that
    mixed apology and warning, saying at the same time, <em>Sorry, I did my
    best</em> and <em>We'd better not press it any further.</em>
5963:
  text: |-
    "As for her being miserable," Professor Quirrell went on, a slight smile now
    playing about his lips, "I suspect that she will have a much easier time with
    the rigors of her position than either of you suspect, and that she will put up
    a good fight much sooner than you think."
5964:
  text: |-
    Harry and Draco both gasped in horror.
5965:
  text: |-
    "You're not going to <em>advise</em> her, are you?" said Draco, utterly aghast.
5966:
  text: |-
    "I never signed up to fight <em>you!</em>â€¯" said Harry.
5967:
  text: |-
    The smile playing around Professor Quirrell's lips grew wider. "As a matter of
    fact, I <em>did</em> offer to share a few suggestions regarding Miss Granger's
    first battles."
5968:
  text: |-
    "<em>Professor Quirrell!</em>â€¯" said Harry.
5969:
  text: |-
    "Oh, don't worry," Professor Quirrell said. "She turned me down. Just as I
    expected."
5970:
  text: |-
    Draco's eyes narrowed.
5971:
  text: |-
    "Dear me, Mr. Potter," said Professor Quirrell, "didn't anyone ever tell you
    it's rude to stare?"
5972:
  text: |-
    "You're not going to secretly help her some <em>other</em> way, are you?" said
    Harry.
5973:
  text: |-
    "Would I do that?" said Professor Quirrell.
5974:
  text: |-
    "Yes," said Draco and Harry at the same time.
5975:
  text: |-
    "I am wounded by your lack of trust. Well then, I promise not to help General
    Granger in any way that the two of you don't know about. And now I suggest that
    both of you be about your military affairs. November approaches, and swiftly."

5976:
  text: |-
    Draco saw the implications before the door had closed all the way behind them on
    their way out of Professor Quirrell's office.
5977:
  text: |-
    Harry had once spoken dismissively of "people stuff".
5978:
  text: |-
    And now that was Draco's only hope.
5979:
  text: |-
    Let him not realize, let him not realize...
5980:
  text: |-
    "We should just attack the Granger girl first and get her out of our way," said
    Draco. "After we crush her, we can have our own contest without any
    distractions."
5981:
  text: |-
    "Now that doesn't really seem fair to her, does it?" said Harry in a mild voice.
5982:
  text: |-
    "What do <em>you</em> care?" said Draco. "She's your rival, right?" Then, with
    just the right note of suspicion in his voice, "Don't tell me you've started
    <em>really</em> liking her, after being her rival all this time..."
5983:
  text: |-
    "Founders forbid," said Harry. "What can I say, Draco? I merely have a natural
    sense of justice. Granger does too, you know. She has a very firm grasp on good
    and evil, and she's probably going to attack evil first. Having a name like
    'Malfoy' is just asking for it, you know."
5984:
  text: |-
    <em>DAMN IT!</em>
5985:
  text: |-
    "Harry," said Draco, sounding wounded and maybe a little superior, "don't you
    want to fight <em>fairly</em> against me?"
5986:
  text: |-
    "You mean rather than attacking you after you've already lost some of your
    forces beating Granger?" said Harry. "Oh, I don't know. Maybe after I get bored
    with just winning I'll try that 'fair' thing."
5987:
  text: |-
    "Maybe she'll attack <em>you,</em>" Draco said. "<em>You're</em> her rival."
5988:
  text: |-
    "But I'm her <em>friendly</em> rival," Harry said with an evil grin. "I bought
    her a nice birthday present and everything. You wouldn't go around sabotaging
    your friendly rival like that."
5989:
  text: |-
    "What about sabotaging your <em>friend's</em> chance at a fair fight?" said
    Draco angrily. "I thought we were friends!"
5990:
  text: |-
    "Let me rephrase that," said Harry. "<em>Granger</em> wouldn't sabotage a
    friendly rival. But that's because she has the killing intention of a bowl of
    wet grapes. <em>You</em> would. You <em>totally</em> would. And guess what, so
    would I."
5991:
  text: |-
    <em>DAMN IT!</em>

    If it had been a play, there would have been dramatic music.
5993:
  text: |-
    The hero, impeccably turned out in green-trimmed robes and perfectly combed
    white-blonde hair, faced the villain.
5994:
  text: |-
    The villain, leaning back in a simple wooden chair with her buckteeth clearly
    visible and stray chestnut curls drifting over her cheeks, faced the hero.
5995:
  text: |-
    It was Wednesday, October 30th, and the first battle was coming up on Sunday.
5996:
  text: |-
    Draco was standing in General Granger's office, a room the size of a small
    classroom. (<em>Why</em> each general's office was so large, Draco wasn't quite
    sure. A chair and a desk would have worked for him. He wasn't even clear on why
    the generals needed offices at all, his soldiers knew where to find him. Unless
    Professor Quirrell had deliberately arranged the huge offices for them as a sign
    of status, in which case Draco was all for it.)
5997:
  text: |-
    Granger sat on the room's single chair like a throne, all the way on the other
    end of the office from where the door opened. There was a long oblong table
    stretched across the middle of the room between them, and four small circular
    tables scattered around the corners, but only that one single chair, all the way
    at the opposite end. The room had windows along one wall, and one beam of
    sunlight touched the top of Granger's hair like a glowing crown.
5998:
  text: |-
    It would have been nice if Draco could have walked slowly forward. But there was
    a table in the way, and Draco had to go around it diagonally, and there was no
    good way to do that in a dramatic and dignified fashion. Had that been
    deliberate? If it had been his father, it surely would have been; but this was
    Granger, so surely not.
5999:
  text: |-
    There was nowhere for him to sit, and Granger hadn't stood up, either.
6000:
  text: |-
    Draco kept the outrage entirely off his face.
6001:
  text: |-
    "Well, Mr. Draco Malfoy," Granger said once he stood before her, "you requested
    an audience with me and I have been so gracious as to grant it. What was your
    plea?"
6002:
  text: |-
    <em>Come with me to visit Malfoy Manor, my father and I would like to show you
    some interesting spells.<br/></em>
6003:
  text: |-
    "Your rival, Potter, came to me with an offer," said Draco, putting a serious
    look on his face. "He doesn't mind losing to me, but would be humiliated if you
    won. So he wants to join with me and wipe you out immediately, not just in our
    first battle, all of them. If I won't do that, Potter wants me to hold back or
    harass you, while he launches an all-out attack on you as his first move."
6004:
  text: |-
    "I see," Granger said, looking surprised. "And you're offering to help me
    against him?"
6005:
  text: |-
    "Of course," said Draco smoothly. "I didn't think what he wanted to do to you
    was fair."
6006:
  text: |-
    "Why, that's very nice of you, Mr. Malfoy," said Granger. "I'm sorry for how I
    spoke to you earlier. We should be friends. Can I call you Drakey?"
6007:
  text: |-
    Alarm bells started to sound in Draco's head, but there was a <em>chance</em>
    she meant it...
6008:
  text: |-
    "Of course," said Draco, "if I can call you Hermy."
6009:
  text: |-
    Draco was pretty sure he saw her expression flicker.
6010:
  text: |-
    "Anyway," Draco said, "I was thinking it would serve Potter right if we both
    attacked him and wiped him out."
6011:
  text: |-
    "But that wouldn't be fair to Mr. Potter, would it?" said Granger.
6012:
  text: |-
    "I think it'd be very fair," Draco said. "He was planning to do it to you
    first."
6013:
  text: |-
    Granger was giving him a stern look that could possibly have intimidated him if
    he'd been a Hufflepuff instead of a Malfoy. "You think I'm pretty stupid, don't
    you, Mr. Malfoy?"
6014:
  text: |-
    Draco smiled charmingly. "No, Miss Granger, but I thought I'd at least
    <em>check.</em> So, what do you want?"
6015:
  text: |-
    "Are you offering to <em>bribe</em> me?" said Granger.
6016:
  text: |-
    "Sure," said Draco. "Can I just slip you a Galleon and have you beat on Potter
    instead of me for the rest of the year?"
6017:
  text: |-
    "Nope," said Granger, "but you can offer me ten Galleons and have me attack both
    of you equally, instead of just you."
6018:
  text: |-
    "Ten Galleons is a lot of money," Draco said cautiously.
6019:
  text: |-
    "I didn't know the Malfoys were poor," said Granger.
6020:
  text: |-
    Draco stared at Granger.
6021:
  text: |-
    He was starting to get a strange feeling about this.
6022:
  text: |-
    That particular reply didn't seem like it should have come from this particular
    girl.
6023:
  text: |-
    "Well," said Draco, "you don't get to be rich by wasting money, you know."
6024:
  text: |-
    "I don't know if you know what a dentist is, Mr. Malfoy, but my parents are
    <em>dentists</em> and anything less than ten Galleons isn't worth my time at
    all."
6025:
  text: |-
    "Three Galleons," Draco said, more as a probe than anything else.
6026:
  text: |-
    "Nope," said Granger. "If you want an equal fight at all, I don't believe that a
    Malfoy wants an equal fight less than he wants ten Galleons."
6027:
  text: |-
    Draco was starting to get a <em>very</em> strange feeling about this.
6028:
  text: |-
    "No," said Draco.
6029:
  text: |-
    "No?" said Granger. "This is a limited time offer, Mr. Malfoy. Are you sure you
    want to risk a whole year of being miserably crushed by the Boy-Who-Lived? That
    would be pretty embarrassing for the House of Malfoy, wouldn't it?"
6030:
  text: |-
    It was a very persuasive argument, one that was hard to refuse, but you didn't
    get to be rich by spending money when your heart told you it was a setup.
6031:
  text: |-
    "No," said Draco.
6032:
  text: |-
    "See you on Sunday," said Granger.
6033:
  text: |-
    Draco turned and walked out of the office without another word.
6034:
  text: |-
    That had been <em>not right...</em>

    "Hermione," Harry said patiently, "we're <em>supposed</em> to be plotting
    against each other. You could even betray me and it wouldn't mean anything
    outside the battlefield."
6036:
  text: |-
    Hermione shook her head. "It wouldn't be nice, Harry."
6037:
  text: |-
    Harry sighed. "I don't think you're getting into the spirit of this at all."
6038:
  text: |-
    <em>It wouldn't be nice.</em> She'd actually said that. Hermione didn't know
    whether to be insulted at what Harry thought of her, or worried about whether
    she really <em>did</em> sound like that much of a goody-two-shoes usually.
6039:
  text: |-
    It was probably time to change the subject.
6040:
  text: |-
    "Anyway, are you doing anything special for tomorrow?" said Hermione. "It's -"
6041:
  text: |-
    Her voice cut off abruptly as she realized.
6042:
  text: |-
    "Yes, Hermione," Harry said a little tightly, "what day is it?"

    <em>Interlude:</em>
6044:
  text: |-
    There was a time when October 31st had been called Halloween in magical Britain.
6045:
  text: |-
    Now it was Harry Potter Day.
6046:
  text: |-
    Harry had turned down all the offers, even the one from Minister Fudge which
    might have been good for future political favors and which he <em>really</em>
    should have gritted his teeth and taken. But to Harry, October 31st would always
    be The Dark Lord Killed My Parents Day. There should have been a quiet,
    dignified memorial service somewhere, and if there was one, he hadn't been
    invited.
6047:
  text: |-
    Hogwarts got the day off to celebrate. Even the Slytherins didn't dare wear
    black outside their own dorm. There were special events and special foods and
    the teachers looked the other way if anyone ran through the hallways. It was the
    tenth anniversary, after all.
6048:
  text: |-
    Harry spent the day in his trunk so as not to spoil it for anyone else, eating
    snack bars in place of meals, reading some of his sadder science fiction books
    (no fantasy), and writing a letter to Mum and Dad that was much longer than the
    ones he usually sent.
