    There was nothing left to do.
16191:

    There was nothing left to plan.
16192:
  text: |-
    There was nothing left to think.
16193:
  text: |-
    Into that emptiness rose the new worst memory -
16194:
  text: |-
    The Boy-Who-Lived-Unlike-His-Best-Friend trudged the long, echoing corridors
    toward the Great Hall. With all his energies of thought exhausted, his mind was
    starting to throw out thoughts like an image of Hermione walking beside him and
    wordless concepts like <em>That will never happen again</em> until another part
    yelled <em>No</em> and shouted it down with determination to bring her back,
    only that part's voice was getting tired and the other part seemed tireless.
    Another part of his mind insisted on reviewing what he'd said to Professor
    McGonagall and Dad and Mum, even though he'd only been trying to get them out of
    there as quickly as possible and had been running on limited mental energy. As
    though somehow he could have done better, by an act of his defective will. What
    would be left of his relationship with his parents now, Harry couldn't guess.

    He came finally to a junction where there waited a older boy in green-fringed
    black robes, silently reading a textbook, on the path that anyone would pick if
    they wanted to intercept someone going from the healer's chambers to the Great
    Hall.
16196:

    Harry was wearing the Cloak of Invisibility, of course, he'd put it on after
    leaving the office, rendering himself immune to almost all forms of magical
    detection. There was no point in making it easy for anyone trying to find him
    and kill him. And Harry was almost set to continue past without bothering to
    find out what was going on, when he recognized the Slytherin boy's face.
16197:
  text: |-
    Realization dawned on Harry then. Of course, one of the students who had stayed
    in school over the Easter holiday would naturally have been -
16198:
  text: |-
    "You were waiting for me," Harry said out loud, without removing the Cloak.
16199:
  text: |-
    The Slytherin boy jerked back, hitting his head against the wall, his fifth-year
    Charms textbook dropping from his hands, before he looked up with wide eyes.
16200:
  text: |-
    "You're -"
16201:
  text: |-
    "Invisible. Yes. Say what you mean to say."
16202:
  text: |-
    Lesath Lestrange scrambled to his feet, a position of attention, then blurted
    out, "My lord, did I do the right thing - I thought you would not wish me to
    step forward before all those others, that they might suspect our connection - I
    thought, surely if you wished my help you would call on me -"
16203:
  text: |-
    It was amazing how many different ways there were to kill your best friend by
    being stupid.
16204:
  text: |-
    "I -" Lesath hesitated, then said in a small voice, "I was wrong, wasn't I?"
16205:
  text: |-
    "You acted exactly as you should have, under the circumstances. It is I who was
    a fool."
16206:
  text: |-
    "I'm sorry, my lord," whispered Lesath.
16207:
  text: |-
    "If you <em>had</em> come with me, would you have been able to kill the troll?"
    It wasn't even the correct question, the correct question was whether Harry
    himself would have considered Lesath as sufficient and flown out sixty seconds
    earlier, but still...
16208:
  text: |-
    "I... I'm not sure, my lord... I am not much welcome to duelling practices in
    Slytherin, I have not learned the gestures to the Killing Curse - should I study
    those arts to better serve you, my lord?"
16209:
  text: |-
    "I continue to insist that I am not your lord," Harry said.
16210:
  text: |-
    "Yes, my lord."
16211:
  text: |-
    "Although," Harry said, "and this is not any kind of order, just a remark,
    anyone ought to know how to defend themselves, especially you. I'm sure the
    Defense Professor would help you with that on general principles, if you asked."
16212:
  text: |-
    Lesath Lestrange bowed and said, "Yes, my lord, I will follow your orders if I
    can, my lord."
16213:
  text: |-
    Harry would have complained about being misunderstood, if he hadn't been
    understood perfectly.
16214:
  text: |-
    Lesath left.
16215:
  text: |-
    Harry stared at the wall.
16216:
  text: |-
    He'd honestly thought that he'd already figured out all the different ways that
    he'd been stupid, after spending half a day thinking about it.
16217:
  text: |-
    Apparently this had just been more overconfidence on his part.
16218:
  text: |-
    <em>Do we understand what we did wrong?</em> his Slytherin side said coldly.
16219:
  text: |-
    <em>Yes,</em> Harry thought.
16220:
  text: |-
    <em>Your ethical qualms don't even make sense. You're not tricking Lesath. You
    did exactly what Lesath thinks you did. You wouldn't have to make excuses for
    why Lesath was helping you, you could just say you were calling in the debt from
    rescuing him from bullies, there were six witnesses to that. Hermione died
    because you forgot about an extremely valuable resource, and you forgot about
    Lesath because... why?</em>
16221:
  text: |-
    <em>Because having Lesath Lestrange for a minion seemed sort of Dark-
    Lordish?</em> Hufflepuff said in a small mental voice. <em>I mean... that
    decision was probably mostly me...</em>
16222:
  text: |-
    Harry's Slytherin side didn't answer that in words, just radiated contempt and
    flashed an image of Hermione's corpse.
16223:
  text: |-
    <em>Stop it!</em> Harry screamed internally.
16224:
  text: |-
    <em>Next time,</em> Slytherin said icily, <em>I suggest that we spend more time
    worrying about what is efficient and effective, and less time worrying about
    what seems sort of Dark-Lordish.</em>
16225:
  text: |-
    <em>Point made,</em> Harry thought, <em>I will.</em>
16226:
  text: |-
    <em>No, you won't,</em> said Slytherin. <em>You'll come up with more
    rationalisations for your petty qualms. You'll start listening to me after
    your</em> next <em>friend dies.</em>
16227:
  text: |-
    Harry was starting to worry that he was going insane. The conversations he had
    with the voices in his head weren't usually like this.

    Harry walked on through the silent corridors.

    "How is Mr. Potter doing?" demanded Professor Quirrell. There was a tension
    about the man, you could not quite call it <em>concern,</em> more like an
    ambusher measuring the time to strike. The Grangers had hardly left with Madam
    Pomfrey before the Defense Professor had knocked upon the door to her office and
    then entered without waiting for her answer, and spoken before she could say a
    word. Part of Minerva wondered distantly whether Harry Potter had picked up that
    habit from his Defense Professor, being unaware of others' pain when there was
    something else on his mind, or if it was only a childish flaw which this man had
    somehow failed to grow out of.
16234:
  text: |-
    "Mr. Potter has ceased guarding Miss Granger's body," she said, putting some of
    the chill she felt into her voice. She felt certain that the Defense Professor
    was not experiencing as much grief as she was, the man had spoken not a single
    word of Hermione Granger. For <em>him</em> to put demands on her - "I believe he
    has gone down to dinner."
16235:
  text: |-
    "I am not asking after the boy's <em>physical</em> state! Have you - has he -"
    Professor Quirrell made a sharp gesture, as though to indicate a concept for
    which he had no words.
16236:
  text: |-
    "Not particularly," she said. She was around thirty seconds away from ordering
    the Defense Professor out of her office.
16237:
  text: |-
    Professor Quirrell began to pace within the small confines of her office. "Miss
    Granger was the only one whose worries he truly heeded - with her gone - all
    checks on the boy's recklessness are removed. I see it now. Who else is there?
    Mr. Longbottom? Mr. Potter does not pretend that they are peers. Flitwick? His
    goblin blood would only cry for vengeance. Mr. Malfoy, if he were returned? To
    what end? Snape? A walking disaster. Dumbledore? Pfah. Events are already set
    for catastrophe, they must be steered along some course they would not naturally
    go. Who might Mr. Potter heed, who would not ordinarily speak to him? Cedric
    Diggory has taught him, but what would Mr. Diggory say in advice? An unknown.
    Mr. Potter spent long in speech with Remus Lupin. To him I have paid little
    heed. Would Lupin know the words to speak, the act which must be done, the
    sacrifice which must be made to change the boy's course?" Professor Quirrell
    whirled on her. "Did Remus Lupin comfort those in grief or stay those moved to
    rash deeds, during his time with the Order of the Phoenix?"
16238:
  text: |-
    "It is not a poor thought," she said slowly. "I believe that Mr. Lupin was often
    a voice of restraint to James Potter in his Hogwarts days."
16239:
  text: |-
    "James Potter," said Professor Quirrell, his eyes narrowing. "The boy is not
    much like James Potter. Are you confident in the success of this plan? No, that
    is the wrong question, we are not limited to a single plan. Are you certain that
    this plan will be <em>enough,</em> that we need essay no others? Asked in such
    fashion, the question answers itself. The path leading to disaster must be
    averted along every possible point of intervention." The Defense Professor had
    resumed pacing the confines of her office, reaching one wall, turning on his
    heel, pacing to the other.
16240:
  text: |-
    "My apologies, Professor," she did not bother keeping the sharpness from her
    voice, "but I have quite reached my limits for the day. You may go."
16241:
  text: |-
    "<em>You</em>." Professor Quirrell spun, and she found herself gazing directly
    into eyes of icy blue. "<em>You</em> would be the first one I would think of
    after Miss Granger, to stay the boy from a folly. Have you already done your
    utmost? Of course you have not."
16242:
  text: |-
    How <em>dare</em> he suggest that. "If you have nothing more to say, Professor,
    then you <em>will</em> go."
16243:
  text: |-
    "Has your confederacy deduced who I really am?" The words were spoken with
    deceptive mildness.
16244:
  text: |-
    "Yes, in fact. Now -"
16245:
  text: |-
    Pure magic, pure power crashed into the room like a flash of lightning, like a
    thunderclap echoing about her ears that deafened her other senses, the papers on
    her desk blown aside not by any conjured wind but by the sheer raw force of
    arcane might.
16246:
  text: |-
    Then the power subsided, leaving only Hermione Granger's death certificates
    drifting down through the air to the floor.
16247:
  text: |-
    "I am David Monroe, who fought Voldemort," the man said, still in mild tones.
    "Heed my words. The boy cannot be allowed to continue in this state of mind. He
    will become <em>dangerous</em>. It is possible that you have already done
    everything you can. Yet I find this a very rare event indeed, and more often
    said than done. I suspect rather that you have only done what you customarily
    do. I cannot truly comprehend what drives others to break their bounds, since I
    never had them. People remain surprisingly passive when faced with the prospect
    of death. Fear of public ridicule or losing one's livelihood is more likely to
    drive men to extremes and the breaking of their customary habits. On the other
    side of the war, the Dark Lord had excellent results from the Cruciatus Curse,
    judiciously used on Marked servants who cannot escape punishment except by
    success, with no reasonable efforts accepted. Imagine their state of mind within
    yourself, and ask yourself whether you have truly done <em>all that you can</em>
    to wrench Harry Potter from his course."
16248:
  text: |-
    "I am a Gryffindor and not much given to being moved by fear," she snapped back.
    "<em>You</em> will exercise courtesy within my office!"
16249:
  text: |-
    "I find fear an excellent motivation, and indeed it is fear that moves me now.
    You-Know-Who, for all his horror, still abided by certain boundaries. It is my
    professional judgment, speaking as a learned wizard almost on par with
    Dumbledore or He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, that the boy could join the ranks of
    those whose rituals are inscribed upon the tombstones of countries. This is not
    an idle worry, McGonagall, I have already heard words to produce the gravest
    apprehensions."
16250:
  text: |-
    "Are you mad? You think that Mr. Potter could - this is ridiculous. Mr. Potter
    cannot possibly -"
16251:
  text: |-
    A wordless image crossed her mind of a patch of glass on a steel ball.
16252:
  text: |-
    "- Mr. Potter <em>would</em> not do such a thing!"
16253:
  text: |-
    "His deliberate choice is not required. Wizards rarely set out to invoke their
    own dooms. Mr. Potter may not strike you as malicious. Does he strike you as
    reckless once he is resolved upon a goal? I say again that I have specific
    reason for the gravest <em>possible</em> concerns!"
16254:
  text: |-
    "Have you spoken to the Headmaster of this?" she said slowly.
16255:
  text: |-
    "That would be worse than pointless. Dumbledore cannot reach the boy. At best he
    is wise enough to know this and make things no worse. I lack the requisite frame
    of mind. <em>You</em> are the one who - but I see that you still look for others
    to save you." The Defense Professor turned from her, and strode to the door. "I
    think I shall consult with Severus Snape. The man may be a walking disaster, but
    he knows the fact, and he may possess a greater understanding of that boy's
    mood. As for you, madam, imagine yourself at the end of your life, knowing that
    Britain - but no, Britain is not your true country, is it? Imagine yourself at
    the end of your life as the darkness eats through the fading walls of Hogwarts,
    knowing that your students will die with you, remembering this day and realizing
    there was something else you could have done."
