    Through green flame they whirled, through the Floo network they spun, Minerva's
    heart racing with a pounding horror that she hadn't felt in ten years and three
    months, the corridors between space coughed and spit them out into the lobby of
    Gringotts (the safest Floo receiver in Diagon Alley, the connection most
    difficult to intercept, the fastest way out of Hogwarts without a phoenix). A
    goblin attendant turned toward them, his eyes widened, he began a slightly
    respectful bow -

  text: |-
    <em>Determination, Destination, Deliberation!</em>
10331:
  text: |-
    And the two of them were in the alley just in back of Mary's Place, wands
    already out and raised, spinning around back-to-back and the words of an Anti-
    Disillusionment Charm already rising to Severus's lips.
10332:
  text: |-
    The alley was empty.
10333:
  text: |-
    When she turned back to look at Severus, his wand was already cracking down on
    his own head with a sound like smashing an egg, as his lips chanted words of
    invisibility; he took on the colors of his surroundings, became a blur of his
    surroundings, the blur moved and matched what was behind him and then there was
    nothing there.
10334:
  text: |-
    She lowered her wand and stepped forward to receive her own Disillusionment -
10335:
  text: |-
    From behind her, the unmistakable sound of a burst of flame.
10336:
  text: |-
    She spun and saw Albus there, his long wand already drawn and raised in his
    right hand. His eyes were grim beneath the half-circles of his glasses, and
    Fawkes upon his shoulder had spread his fire-colored wings in readiness for
    flight and fight.
10337:
  text: |-
    "Albus!" she said. "I thought -" She'd just seen him depart for Azkaban, and
    she'd thought not even phoenixes could return from there so easily.
10338:
  text: |-
    Then she realized.
10339:
  text: |-
    "She escaped," said Albus. "Did your Patronus reach him?"
10340:
  text: |-
    The pounding in her heart grew stronger, the horror in her veins solidified. "He
    said he was here, in the washroom -"
10341:
  text: |-
    "Let us hope he spoke true," said Albus, the wand tapped her head with a
    sensation like water trickling over her, and a moment later the four of them
    (even Fawkes had been rendered invisible, though sometimes you saw a flicker of
    something like fire in his air) were racing to the front of the restaurant. They
    paused before the door while Albus whispered something, and a moment later one
    of the customers visible through the windows stood up with a vague look on his
    face and opened the door as though taking a quick look outside for some friend;
    and the three of them were through, racing past the unwitting customers (Severus
    was marking their faces, Minerva knew, and Albus would see any Disillusioned)
    toward the sign that pointed to the washroom -
10342:
  text: |-
    An old wooden door marked with the sign of a toilet burst open with a slam, and
    four invisible rescuers stormed through it.
10343:
  text: |-
    The small but clean wooden room was empty, fresh droplets of water showed in the
    sink but there was no sign of Harry, only a sheet of paper left on the closed
    lid of the toilet.
10344:
  text: |-
    She couldn't breathe.
10345:
  text: |-
    The sheet of paper rose up into the air as Albus took it, and a moment later was
    thrust in her own direction.
10346:
  text: |-
    <em>M: What did the hat tell me to tell you?</em>
10347:
  text: |-
    <em>- H</em>
10348:
  text: |-
    "Ah," Minerva said aloud in surprise, her mind taking a moment to place the
    question, it wasn't the sort of thing you'd forget but she hadn't been thinking
    in that <em>mode,</em> really - "I'm an impudent youngster and I should get off
    its lawn."
10349:
  text: |-
    "<em>Eh?</em> " said the air in Albus's voice, as if even he could be shocked.
10350:
  text: |-
    And then Harry Potter's head appeared, suspended next to the air beside the
    toilet, his face was cold and alert, the too-adult Harry she'd seen sometimes,
    eyes darting back and forth and around.
10351:
  text: |-
    "What's going on -" the boy began.
10352:
  text: |-
    Albus, now visible once more along with her and Fawkes, was moving forward in an
    instant, his left hand reached forward and plucked a hair from Harry's head
    (producing a startled yelp from the boy), Minerva accepted the hair in her own
    hand, and a moment later Albus swept up the mostly-invisible boy in his arms and
    there was a flash of red-golden fire.
10353:
  text: |-
    And Harry Potter was safe.
10354:
  text: |-
    Minerva took a few steps forward, leaned against the wall where Albus and Harry
    had been, trying to recover her poise.
10355:
  text: |-
    She'd... lost some habits, in the ten years since the Order of the Phoenix had
    disbanded.
10356:
  text: |-
    Beside her, Severus shimmered into visibility. His right hand was already
    drawing forth the flask from his robes, his left hand already stretching forth
    in demand. She gave him Harry's hair, and a moment later, it dropped into the
    flask of unfinished Polyjuice, which at once began fizzing and bubbling as it
    settled into the potency that would enable Severus to act his part as bait.
10357:
  text: |-
    "That was unexpected," the Potions Master said slowly. "Why did our Headmaster
    not retrieve Mr. Potter <em>earlier</em>, I wonder, if he was going so far as to
    twist Time? There should have been nothing preventing him from doing so...
    indeed, your Patronus should have found Mr. Potter already safe..."
10358:
  text: |-
    She hadn't thought of that, a different realization having jumped to the
    forefront of her mind. It wasn't nearly as horrifying as Bellatrix Black having
    escaped from Azkaban, but still -
10359:
  text: |-
    "Harry has an <em>invisibility cloak?</em> " she said.
10360:
  text: |-
    The Potions Master did not answer; he was shrinking.
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
10361:
  text: |-
    Tick-snick, drip-blip, ding-ring-ting-
10362:
  text: |-
    It still annoyed her, though it faded past attention after a while; and when and
    if she became Headmistress, she intended to Silence the whole lot. Which Head of
    Hogwarts, she wondered, had first been so inconsiderate as to create a device
    that made <em>noise</em>, to pass on to their successors?
10363:
  text: |-
    She was sitting in the Headmaster's office with a quickly Transfigured desk of
    her own, doing some of the hundred little pieces of necessary paperwork that
    kept Hogwarts from grinding to a halt; she could lose herself in it easily, and
    it prevented her from thinking about other things. Albus had once remarked,
    sounding rather wry, that Hogwarts seemed to run even more smoothly when there
    was an outside crisis for her to avoid thinking about...
10364:
  text: |-
    ...ten years ago, that was the last time Albus had said that.
10365:
  text: |-
    There was the chime that indicated an approaching visitor.
10366:
  text: |-
    Minerva kept reading her current parchment.
10367:
  text: |-
    The door slammed open, revealing Severus Snape, who took three steps inward and
    demanded without the slightest pause, "Any word from Mad-Eye?"
10368:
  text: |-
    Albus was already rising from his chair, even as she tucked away her parchments
    and dispelled the desk. "Moody's Patronus is reporting to the me in Azkaban,"
    Albus said. "His Eye saw nothing; and if the Eye of Vance does not see a thing,
    then that thing does not exist. Yourself?"
10369:
  text: |-
    "No one has tried to forcibly take my blood," Severus said. He gave a quick
    grimace of a smile. "Except the Defense Professor."
10370:
  text: |-
    "<em>What?</em> " said Minerva.
10371:
  text: |-
    "He saw me for an impostor before I could even open my lips, and quite
    reasonably attacked me on the spot, demanding to know the whereabouts of Mr.
    Potter." Another grimace of a smile. "Shouting that I was Severus Snape did not
    seem to reassure him, for some reason. I do believe that man would kill me for a
    Sickle and give back five Knuts change. I had to stun our good Professor
    Quirrell, which was not easy, and then he reacted poorly to the hex. 'Harry
    Potter', naturally alarmed, ran out and told the owner, and the Defense
    Professor was taken to St. Mungos -"
10372:
  text: |-
    "<em>St. Mungos?</em> "
10373:
  text: |-
    "- which said he had probably been overworking himself for weeks before he
    collapsed, such was his state of exhaustion. Your precious Defense Professor is
    fine, Minerva, the stunner may have helped him by forcing him to take a few days
    off. Afterward I declined the offer of a Floo to Hogwarts, and went back to
    Diagon Alley and wandered; but no one seems to have wanted Mr. Potter's blood
    today."
10374:
  text: |-
    "Our Defense Professor is in the best of hands, I am sure," said Albus. "Greater
    matters command our attention, Minerva."
10375:
  text: |-
    It took considerable effort for her to wrench her attention back, but she sat
    back down, and Severus gestured up a chair for himself as well, and the three of
    them drew together to begin their council.
10376:
  text: |-
    She felt like a Polyjuiced impostor, sitting with those two. War was not her
    art, nor plotting. She had to strain to keep one step ahead of the Weasley
    twins, and sometimes she failed at that. She was sitting here, ultimately, only
    because she had heard the prophecy...
10377:
  text: |-
    "We are faced," the Headmaster spoke first, "with a rather alarming mystery. I
    can think of only two wizards who might have engineered this escape."
10378:
  text: |-
    Minerva drew in her breath sharply. "There is a chance it is <em>not</em> You-
    Know-Who?"
10379:
  text: |-
    "I'm afraid so," said the Headmaster.
10380:
  text: |-
    She glanced to her side and saw that Severus looked as puzzled as herself.
    <em>Afraid</em> the Dark Lord was not rising again? She would have given almost
    anything for that to be true.
10381:
  text: |-
    "So," Albus said heavily. "Our first suspect is Voldemort, risen again and
    seeking to resurrect himself. I have studied many books I wish I had not read,
    seeking his every possible avenue of return, and I have found only three. His
    strongest road to life is the Philosopher's Stone, which Flamel assures me that
    not even Voldemort could create on his own; by that road he would rise greater
    and more terrible than ever before. I would not have thought Voldemort able to
    resist the temptation of the Stone, still less because such an obvious trap is a
    challenge to his wit. But his second avenue is nearly as strong: The flesh of
    his servant, willingly given; the blood of his foe, forcibly taken; and the bone
    of his ancestor, unknowingly bequeathed. Voldemort is a perfectionist -" Albus
    glanced at Severus, who nodded agreement, "- and he would certainly seek the
    most powerful combination: the flesh of Bellatrix Black, the blood of Harry
    Potter, and the bone of his father. Voldemort's final avenue is to seduce a
    victim and drain the life from them over a long period; in which case Voldemort
    would be weak compared to his former power. His motive to spirit away Bellatrix
    is clear. And if he is keeping her in reserve, to use only in case he cannot
    attain the Stone, that would explain why no kidnap attempt was made on Harry
    this day."
10382:
  text: |-
    Minerva glanced again at Severus, saw him listening attentively but without
    surprise.
10383:
  text: |-
    "What is <em>not</em> clear," the Headmaster continued, "is <em>how</em>
    Voldemort could have engineered this escape. A death doll was left in
    Bellatrix's place, her escape was meant to be undetected; and even though that
    went wrong, the Dementors could not find her after their first warning. Azkaban
    has stood impenetrable for centuries, and I cannot imagine any means by which
    Voldemort could have accomplished this."
10384:
  text: |-
    "That may mean little," Severus said, expressionless. "For the Dark Lord to do
    what we cannot imagine requires only that he has a better imagination."
10385:
  text: |-
    Albus nodded grimly. "Unfortunately there is now another wizard who laughs at
    impossibilities. A wizard who, not long ago, developed a new and powerful Charm
    which could have blinded the Dementors to Bellatrix Black's escape. And he is
    implicated for other reasons, as well."
10386:
  text: |-
    Minerva's heart was skipping beats, she didn't know <em>how,</em> or
    <em>why,</em> but a terrible apprehension was dawning on her as to <em>who
    -</em>
10387:
  text: |-
    "Who would <em>that</em> be?" said Severus, sounding puzzled.
10388:
  text: |-
    Albus leaned back and said the fatal words, even as she had feared them: "Harry
    James Potter-Evans-Verres."
10389:
  text: |-
    "<em>Potter?</em> " demanded the Potions Master, as much shock in that usually-
    silken voice as she had ever heard from him. "Headmaster, is this one of your
    jokes? He is in his first year at Hogwarts! A temper tantrum and a few childish
    pranks with an invisibility cloak does not make him -"
10390:
  text: |-
    "It is no joke," said Minerva, her voice barely above a whisper. "Harry is
    already making original discoveries in Transfiguration, Severus. Though I did
    not know he was researching Charms as well."
10391:
  text: |-
    "Harry is no ordinary first-year," the Headmaster said solemnly. "He is marked
    as the Dark Lord's equal, and he has power the Dark Lord knows not."
10392:
  text: |-
    Severus was looking at her, and you would have needed to know him well to
    recognize that his glance was pleading. "Am I to take this seriously?"
10393:
  text: |-
    Minerva simply nodded.
10394:
  text: |-
    "Does anyone <em>else</em> know of this... new and powerful Charm?" Severus
    demanded.
10395:
  text: |-
    The Headmaster glanced at her apologetically -
10396:
  text: |-
    Somehow she knew, she knew before he even said it, and she wanted to scream at
    the top of her lungs.
10397:
  text: |-
    - and said, "Quirinus Quirrell."
10398:
  text: |-
    "<em>Why,</em>" she said, in a voice that should have melted half the devices in
    the office, "<em>did Mr. Potter even TELL our Defense Professor about his
    brilliant new Charm for breaking out of prisons -</em>"
10399:
  text: |-
    The Headmaster passed a weary wrinkled hand across his equally wrinkled
    forehead. "Quirinus just happened to be there, Minerva. Even I saw no harm in it
    at the time." The Headmaster hesitated. "And Harry said his Charm was too
    dangerous to be explained to either of us; and when I asked him again, this day,
    he insisted he had still not explained it to Quirinus, nor had he ever dropped
    his Occlumency barriers in the Defense Professor's presence -"
10400:
  text: |-
    "Mr. Potter is an <em>Occlumens?</em> You gave him an invisibility cloak and he
    is immune to Veritaserum <em>and he is friends with the Weasley twins?</em>
    Albus, do you have any idea what you have unleashed upon this school?" Her voice
    was nearly shrieking, now. "By his seventh year there won't be anything left of
    Hogwarts but a smoking hole in the ground!"
10401:
  text: |-
    Albus leaned back in his great cushioned chair, and said, smiling, "Don't forget
    the Time-Turner."
10402:
  text: |-
    She did scream then, but quietly.
10403:
  text: |-
    Severus drawled, "Should I teach him to brew Polyjuice, Headmaster? I ask only
    for the sake of completeness, in case you are not satisfied with the magnitude
    of your pet disaster."
10404:
  text: |-
    "Perhaps next year," said Albus. "My dearest friends, the question before us is
    whether Harry Potter has spirited Bellatrix Black out of Azkaban, which is more
    than youthful high spirits even by my tolerant standards."
10405:
  text: |-
    "Excuse me, Headmaster," Severus said with one of the dryer smiles she had ever
    seen him deliver to Albus, "but I will register my opinion that the answer is
    no. This is the Dark Lord's work, pure and simple."
10406:
  text: |-
    "Then why," Albus said, and now there was no humor at all in his voice, "when I
    planned to retrieve Harry immediately after his arrival in Diagon Alley, did I
    find that this would result in paradox?"
10407:
  text: |-
    Minerva sank further back into her chair, dropped her left elbow onto the hard
    uncushioned armrest, leaned her head into her hand, and shut her eyes in
    despair.
10408:
  text: |-
    There was a narrowly circulated proverb to the effect that only one Auror in
    thirty was qualified to investigate cases involving Time-Turners; and that of
    those few, the half who weren't <em>already</em> insane, soon would be.
10409:
  text: |-
    "So you suspect," Severus's voice was saying, "that Potter went from Diagon
    Alley to Azkaban, then looped back to Diagon Alley afterward to be picked up by
    us -"
10410:
  text: |-
    "Precisely," said Albus's voice. "Though it is also possible that Voldemort or
    his servants watched to make sure Harry did arrive in Diagon Alley, before they
    began their attempt on Azkaban. And that they had someone with a Time-Turner who
    would send back the message of their success, to trigger the abduction. Indeed,
    it was my suspicion of this possibility that caused me to dispatch you and
    Minerva on your own mission, before I myself went to Azkaban. I thought then
    that their breakout would fail, but if retrieving Harry Potter meant observing
    the fact of their eventual failure, then I myself could not have gone to Azkaban
    after I had interacted with him, for Azkaban's future cannot touch its past.
    When, in Azkaban, I received no report from you or Minerva, nor from Flitwick
    whom I told to try contacting you, I knew that your interaction with Harry
    Potter had been an interaction with Azkaban's future, meaning that someone was
    sending messages through Time -"
10411:
  text: |-
    Then Albus's voice stopped.
10412:
  text: |-
    "But Headmaster," said Severus, "<em>you</em> came back from Azkaban's future
    and interacted with us..."
10413:
  text: |-
    The Potions Master's voice trailed off.
10414:
  text: |-
    "But Severus, if I had <em>received</em> reports from you and Minerva of Harry's
    safety, I would not, in the first place, have gone backward in time to -"
10415:
  text: |-
    "Headmaster, I think we must draw diagrams for this."
10416:
  text: |-
    "I agree, Severus."
10417:
  text: |-
    There was the sound of parchment being spread on a table, and then quills
    scratching, and more arguing.
10418:
  text: |-
    Minerva sat in her chair, head resting in her hand, eyes shut.
10419:
  text: |-
    There was a story she'd once heard about a criminal who had possessed a Time-
    Turner which the Department of Mysteries had sealed to him, in a case of
    extremely bad judgment as to who needed one; and there had been an Auror
    assigned to track down this unknown time-criminal, who had also been given a
    Time-Turner; and the story ended with both of them in St. Mungo's ward for Total
    Unrecoverable Nutcases.
10420:
  text: |-
    Minerva sat there with her eyes shut, trying not to listen, trying not to think
    about it, and trying not to go insane.
10421:
  text: |-
    After awhile, when the argument seemed to have wound down, she said aloud, "Mr.
    Potter's Time-Turner is restricted to the hours of nine PM through midnight. Was
    the shell tampered with, Albus?"
10422:
  text: |-
    "Not to my most discerning Charms," said Albus. "But the shells are new things;
    and to defeat the Unspeakables' precautions and leave no trace of the defeat...
    might <em>not</em> be impossible."
10423:
  text: |-
    She opened her eyes, and saw Severus and the Headmaster staring intently at a
    parchment covered with tangled squiggles that would have no doubt driven her mad
    to comprehend.
10424:
  text: |-
    "Have you come to any <em>conclusions?</em> " Minerva said. "And please don't
    tell me how you arrived at them."
10425:
  text: |-
    Severus and the Headmaster looked at each other, then turned to look at her.
10426:
  text: |-
    "We have concluded," the Headmaster said gravely, "that either Harry was
    involved or he was not; that either Voldemort has access to a Time-Turner or he
    does not; and that regardless of what could have happened within Azkaban, nobody
    would have visited the Little Hangleton graveyard during the period Moody has
    already watched over it within my own past."
10427:
  text: |-
    "In short," Severus drawled, "we know nothing, dear Minerva; though it seems at
    least <em>likely</em> that another Time-Turner was involved, somehow. My own
    suspicion is that Potter has been bribed, tricked, or threatened into conveying
    messages backward in time, perhaps even regarding this very prison break. I
    shall not make the obvious suggestion as to who is pulling his strings. But I
    suggest that at nine o' clock tonight, we test whether Potter is able to travel
    the full six hours backward to three o' clock, to see if he has yet used his
    Time-Turner."
10428:
  text: |-
    "That seems wise to do in any case," said Dumbledore. "See that done, Minerva,
    and tell Harry to stop in my office at his convenience, afterward."
10429:
  text: |-
    "But you still suspect Harry of direct involvement in the prison break itself?"
    Minerva said.
10430:
  text: |-
    "Possible but unlikely," said Severus, at the same time Albus said, "Yes."
10431:
  text: |-
    Minerva pinched the bridge of her nose, took a deep breath, let it out. "Albus,
    Severus, what possible <em>reason</em> has Mr. Potter to do such a thing!"
10432:
  text: |-
    "None that I can think of," said Albus, "but it remains that Harry's magics
    alone, of all the means known to me, might have -"
10433:
  text: |-
    "Hold," said Severus. All expression vanished from his face. "A thought occurs
    to me, I must check -" The Potions Master seized a pinch of Floo powder, strode
    across the room toward the fireplace - Albus hastily waved his wand to light it
    - and then in a flare of green flame, and the words "Slytherin Head of House
    office", Severus was gone.
10434:
  text: |-
    She and Albus looked at each other and both shrugged; and then Albus turned back
    to studying the parchment.
10435:
  text: |-
    It was only a few minutes later that Severus spun back out of the Floo, brushing
    traces of ash from himself.
10436:
  text: |-
    "Well," said the Potions Master. Again the expressionless face. "I am afraid
    that Mr. Potter does have a motive."
10437:
  text: |-
    "Speak!" said Albus.
10438:
  text: |-
    "I found Lesath Lestrange in the Slytherin common room, studying," Severus said.
    "He was not reluctant to meet my eyes. And it seems that Mr. Lestrange did not
    like to think of his parents in Azkaban, in the cold and the darkness, with the
    Dementors sucking away their life, hurting every second of every day, and he
    told Mr. Potter so in as many words, and begged him to get them out. Since, you
    see, Mr. Lestrange had heard that the Boy-Who-Lived could do anything."
10439:
  text: |-
    She and Albus exchanged glances.
10440:
  text: |-
    "Severus," Minerva said, "<em>surely...</em> even <em>Harry</em>... has more
    common sense than <em>that...</em>"
10441:
  text: |-
    Her voice trailed off.
10442:
  text: |-
    "Mr. Potter thinks he is God," Severus said without expression, "and Lesath
    Lestrange fell to his knees before him in a heartfelt cry of prayer."
10443:
  text: |-
    Minerva stared at Severus, feeling sick to her stomach. She had studied Muggle
    religion - it was the most common reason for needing to Memory-Charm the parents
    of Muggleborns - and she knew enough to understand what Severus had just said.
10444:

    "In any case," said the Potions Master. "I looked within Mr. Lestrange to see if
    he knew anything of his mother's escape. He has heard nothing. But the instant
    he learns, he will conclude that the person responsible was Harry Potter."
10445:
  text: |-
    "I see..." Albus said slowly. "Thank you, Severus. That is good news."
10446:
  text: |-
    "<em>Good news?</em> " Minerva burst out.
10447:
  text: |-
    Albus looked at her, his face as expressionless as Severus's, now; and she
    remembered, with a shock, that Albus's own - "It is the best reason I can
    possibly imagine for removing Bellatrix from Azkaban," Albus said quietly. "And
    if it is <em>not</em> Harry, let us recall, then it is certainly Voldemort
    himself making his first moves. But let us not be hasty in judgment while there
    is much we do not yet know, but soon will."
10448:
  text: |-
    Albus once more stood up from behind his desk, strode to the fireplace still
    alight, cast in another pinch of green powder, and stuck his head into the
    flames. "Department of Magical Law Enforcement," he said, "Director's office."
10449:
  text: |-
    After a moment, the voice of Madam Bones came through clear and sharp, "What is
    it, Albus? I am somewhat busy."
10450:
  text: |-
    "Amelia," said Albus, "I beg of you to share any discoveries you have made
    concerning this matter."
10451:
  text: |-
    There was a pause. "Oh," said the cold voice of Madam Bones from the blazing
    fire, "and is that a two-way road then, Albus?"
10452:
  text: |-
    "It may be," the old wizard said calmly.
10453:
  text: |-
    "If any Auror dies of your reticence, old meddler, I will hold you responsible
    in full measure."
10454:
  text: |-
    "I understand, Amelia," Albus said, "but I have no wish to spark needless alarm
    and incredulity -"
10455:
  text: |-
    "<em>Bellatrix Black</em> has escaped from <em>Azkaban!</em> What alarm or
    incredulity do you think I will call <em>needless,</em> in the face of that?"
10456:
  text: |-
    "I may call on you to remember those words," said the old wizard into the green
    flames. "For if I learn that my fears are not needless, I <em>will</em> tell
    you. Now, Amelia, I beg you, if you have learned anything whatsoever upon this
    matter, please share it."
10457:
  text: |-
    There was another pause, and then Madam Bones's voice said, "I have information
    which I learned four hours into the future, Albus. Do you still want it?"
10458:
  text: |-
    Albus paused -
10459:
  text: |-
    (weighing, Minerva knew, the possibility that he might want to go back more than
    two hours from this instant; for you couldn't send information further back in
    time than six hours, not through any chain of Time-Turners)
10460:
  text: |-
    - and finally said, "Yes, please."
10461:
  text: |-
    "We had a lucky break," said Madam Bones's voice, "one of the Aurors who
    witnessed the escape was a Muggleborn, and she told us that the Flying-Fire
    spell, as we were calling it, might be no spell at all, but a Muggle artifact."
10462:
  text: |-
    Like a punch in the stomach, that was how it felt, and the sickness in Minerva's
    belly redoubled. Anyone who'd watched a Chaos Legion battle knew whose hand that
    showed...
10463:
  text: |-
    Madam Bones's voice continued. "We brought in Arthur Weasley from Misuse of
    Muggle Artifacts - he knows more about Muggle artifacts than any wizard alive -
    and gave him the descriptions from the Aurors on the scene, and he cracked it.
    It was a Muggle artifact called a rocker, and they call it that because you'd
    have to be off your rocker to ride one. Just six years ago one of their rockers
    blew up, killed hundreds of Muggles in a flash and almost set fire to the Moon.
    Weasley says that rockers use a special kind of science called opposite
    reaction, so the plan is to develop a jinx which will prevent that science from
    working around Azkaban."
10464:
  text: |-
    "Thank you, Amelia," Albus said gravely. "Is that everything?"
10465:
  text: |-
    "I'll check if we have anything from six hours forward," said the voice of Madam
    Bones, "if so they wouldn't have told me, but I'll have them tell you. Do
    <em>you</em> have anything you want to tell me, Albus? Which of those two
    possibilities is it looking like?"
10466:
  text: |-
    "Not yet, Amelia," Albus said, "but I may have word for you soon."
10467:
  text: |-
    He straightened up from the fire, then, which faded back to ordinary yellow
    flames. Every minute of the old wizard's years, every natural second since his
    birth and every second which Time-Turning had added, all of that plus a few
    extra decades for stress, was visible on his lined face.
10468:
  text: |-
    "Severus?" the old wizard said. "What was it actually?"
10469:
  text: |-
    "A rocket," said the half-blood Potions Master, who had grown up in the Muggle
    town of Spinner's End. "One of the most impressive Muggle technologies."
10470:
  text: |-
    "How likely is <em>Harry</em> to know such arts?" said Minerva.
10471:
  text: |-
    Severus drawled, "Oh, a boy like Mr. Potter knows <em>all</em> about rockets;
    that, dear Minerva, is a certainty. You must remember that things are done
    differently in the Muggle world." Severus frowned. "But rockets <em>are</em>
    dangerous, and expensive..."
10472:
  text: |-
    "Harry has stolen and hidden an unknown amount of money from his Gringotts
    vault, perhaps thousands of Galleons," said the Headmaster, and then, to their
    twin stares, "That was <em>not</em> in my plan, but I made the mistake of
    sending the Defense Professor to supervise Harry's withdrawal of five Galleons
    for Christmas presents..." The Headmaster shrugged. "Yes, I agree, sheer folly
    in retrospect, let us continue."
10473:
  text: |-
    Minerva quietly thudded her head a few times against the headrest of her chair.
10474:
  text: |-
    "Nonetheless, Headmaster," Severus said. "Just because the Death Eaters never
    used Muggle artifacts in the first war, that does not mean <em>he</em> is
    ignorant. Rockets fell on Britain as weapons, in the Muggle side of
    Grindelwald's war. If he spent the summers of those years in a Muggle orphanage,
    as you told us, Headmaster... then he, too, has heard of rockets. And if he has
    been listening to reports of Mr. Potter and his mock battles using Muggle
    artifacts, he would certainly learn his enemy's strengths and try to redouble
    them himself. That is <em>just</em> how he thinks; any power he sees he will try
    to take for his own."
10475:
  text: |-
    The old wizard was standing stock still, utterly motionless, even the hairs of
    his beard frozen in place like solid wires; and the thought came to Minerva, as
    frightening as any thought she'd ever had, that Albus Dumbledore was rooted to
    the spot in horror.
10476:
  text: |-
    "Severus," Albus Dumbledore said, and his voice almost cracked, "do you realize
    what you are saying? If Harry Potter and Voldemort fight their war with Muggle
    weapons there will be nothing left of the world but fire!"
10477:
  text: |-
    "<em>What?</em> " said Minerva. She had heard of guns, of course, but they
    weren't <em>that</em> dangerous to an experienced witch -
10478:
  text: |-
    Severus spoke as though she weren't in the room. "Then perhaps, Headmaster, he
    is sending a deliberate warning to Harry Potter of exactly that; saying that any
    attack with Muggle weapons will be met with retaliation in kind. Command Mr.
    Potter to cease his use of Muggle technology in his battles; that will show him
    the message is received... and not give him any more ideas." Severus frowned.
    "Though, come to think of it, Mr. Malfoy - and of course Miss Granger - well, on
    second thought a blanket prohibition on technology seems wiser -"
10479:
  text: |-
    The old wizard pressed both his hands to his forehead, and from his lips came an
    unsteady voice, "I begin to <em>hope</em> that it is Harry behind this escape...
    oh, Merlin defend us all, what have I done, what have I done, what will become
    of the world?"
10480:
  text: |-
    Severus shrugged. "From the rumors I have heard, Headmaster, Muggle weapons are
    only slightly worse than the more... <em>recondite</em> aspects of wizardry -"
10481:
  text: |-
    "<em>Worse?</em> " gasped Minerva, and then shut her mouth as though by force.
10482:
  text: |-
    "Worse than any peril left in these fading years," said Albus. "Not worse than
    that which erased Atlantis from Time."
10483:
  text: |-
    Minerva stared at him, feeling the sweat break out all along her spine.
10484:
  text: |-
    Severus continued, still addressing Albus. "All the Death Eaters save Bellatrix
    would have betrayed him, all his supporters turned against him, all the powers
    of the world converged to destroy him, if he had been reckless with any truly
    dangerous potency. Is this so different, then?"
10485:
  text: |-
    Some motion, some color, had returned to the old wizard's face. "Perhaps not..."
10486:
  text: |-
    "And in any case," Severus said with a slightly condescending smile, "Muggle
    weapons are not so easy to obtain, not for a thousand Galleons or a thousand
    thousand."
10487:
  text: |-
    <em>Doesn't Harry just Transfigure the devices he uses in his battles?</em>
    thought Minerva, but before she could open her mouth to ask -
10488:
  text: |-
    The fireplace erupted in green flames, then, and the face of Pius Thicknesse,
    Madam Bones's assistant, appeared therein. "Chief Warlock?" said Thicknesse. "I
    have a report for you, transmitted from -" Thicknesse's eyes flickered over
    Minerva and Severus, "six minutes ago."
10489:
  text: |-
    "Six hours ahead, you mean," said Albus. "These two are meant to hear it;
    deliver your report."
10490:
  text: |-
    "We know how it was done," said Thicknesse. "In Bellatrix Black's cell, hidden
    in one corner, was a potions vial; and testing the traces of remaining fluid
    shows that it was an Animagus potion."
10491:
  text: |-
    There was a long pause.
10492:
  text: |-
    "I see..." Albus said heavily.
10493:
  text: |-
    "Pardon me?" said Minerva. She didn't.
10494:
  text: |-
    Thicknesse's head turned toward her. "Animagi, Madam McGonagall, in their
    Animagus forms, are of less interest to Dementors. All prisoners are tested
    before their arrival at Azkaban; and if they are Animagi, their Animagus form is
    destroyed. But we had not considered that someone protected by a Patronus Charm
    while taking the potion and performing the meditation, might be able to become
    an Animagus <em>after</em> they went to Azkaban -"
10495:
  text: |-
    "I understood," Severus said, having by now put on his customary sneer, "that
    the Animagus meditation required considerable time."
10496:
  text: |-
    "Well, Mr. Snape," Thicknesse barked, "records show that Bellatrix Black was an
    Animagus <em>before</em> she was sentenced to Azkaban and her form destroyed; so
    maybe her <em>second</em> meditation didn't take as much time as her first!"
10497:
  text: |-
    "I would not have thought it possible for any prisoner of Azkaban to do such a
    thing..." Albus said. "But Bellatrix Black was a most powerful sorceress before
    her incarceration, and she might have done it if any witch could. Can Azkaban be
    secured against this method?"
10498:
  text: |-
    "Yes," said the confident head of Pius Thicknesse. "Our expert says that it is
    nigh-unimaginable that an Animagus meditation could be performed in less than
    three hours, regardless of experience. All visits to prisoners allowed to
    receive them will be limited to two hours henceforth, and the Dementors will
    inform us if any Patronus Charm is maintained in the prison areas for longer
    than that."
10499:
  text: |-
    Albus looked unhappy at that, but nodded. "I see. There will be no further
    attempts of that sort, of course, but do not relax your vigilance. And when
    Amelia has been told all this, tell her that I have information for her."
10500:
  text: |-
    The head of Pius Thicknesse vanished without another word.
10501:
  text: |-
    "No further attempts...?" said Minerva.
10502:
  text: |-
    "Because, dear Minerva," Severus drawled, having not quite taken off his
    habitual sneer, "if the Dark Lord had planned to free any of his other servants
    from Azkaban, he would not have left behind the vial of potion to tell us how it
    was done." Severus frowned. "I confess... even so I do not see why that vial was
    left there."
10503:
  text: |-
    "It is some kind of message..." Albus said slowly. "And I cannot see what it
    means, not at all..." He drummed his fingers on his desk.
10504:
  text: |-
    For a long minute or three, the old wizard stared off into nothingness,
    frowning; while Severus also sat in silence.
10505:
  text: |-
    Then Albus shook his head in dismay, and said, "Severus, do <em>you</em>
    comprehend this?"
10506:
  text: |-
    "No," said the Potions Master, and with a sardonic smile, "which is probably all
    the better for us; whatever we are <em>intended</em> to conclude from it, that
    part of his plan has misfired."
10507:
  text: |-
    "You are certain, now, that it <em>is</em> You-Know... that it is Voldemort?"
    said Minerva. "It could not be that some other Death Eater conceived this clever
    notion?"
10508:
  text: |-
    "And they knew about rockets, too?" Severus said dryly. "I don't believe the
    other Death Eaters were so fond of Muggle Studies. It is he."
10509:
  text: |-
    "Aye, it is he," Albus said. "Azkaban has endured impenetrable for ages, only to
    fall to an ordinary Animagus potion. It is too clever and too impossible, which
    was ever Voldemort's signature since the days he was known as Tom Riddle. Anyone
    who wished to forge that signature must needs be as cunning as Voldemort himself
    to do so. And there is no one else in the world who would accidentally
    overestimate my wit, and leave me a message I cannot understand at all."
10510:
  text: |-
    "Unless he has gauged you exactly," Severus said tonelessly, "in which case all
    that is just what he intended you to think."
10511:
  text: |-
    Albus sighed. "Indeed. But even if he has tricked me perfectly, we may at least
    rely on the conclusion that it was not Harry Potter."
10512:
  text: |-
    It should have come as a relief, and yet Minerva felt the chill spreading
    through her spine and her veins, her lungs and her bones.
10513:
  text: |-
    She remembered conversations like this.
10514:
  text: |-
    She remembered conversations like this from ten years ago, from a time when
    blood had run through Britain in wide rivers, when wizards and witches she had
    once taught in class had been slaughtered by the hundreds, she remembered
    burning homes and screaming children and flashes of green light -
10515:
  text: |-
    "What will you tell Madam Bones?" she whispered.
10516:
  text: |-
    Albus stood from his desk and paced to the center of the room, his hand lightly
    touching the devices, here an instrument of light, there an instrument of sound;
    he adjusted his glasses with one hand, used the other to center the long silver
    beard against his robes, and then finally that ancient wizard turned back and
    faced them.
10517:
  text: |-
    "I will tell her what little I know of the Dark Art called horcrux, by which a
    soul is deprived of death," said Albus Dumbledore, in a soft voice that seemed
    to fill the whole room, "and I will tell her what may be done with the flesh of
    the servant."
10518:
  text: |-
    "I will tell her that I am reconstituting the Order of the Phoenix."
10519:
  text: |-
    "I will tell her that Voldemort has returned."
10520:
  text: |-
    "And that the Second Wizarding War is begun."
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
10521:
  text: |-
    <em>Some hours later...</em>
10522:
  text: |-
    The antique old clock upon the wall of the Deputy Headmistress's office had
    golden hands, and silver numerals to make the clock-face; it ticked and jerked
    soundlessly through its motions, for there was a Quieting enchantment on it.
10523:
  text: |-
    The golden hour hand approached the silver numeral of nine, the golden minute
    hand did the same, the two linked components of Time nearing each other, soon to
    be in the same place and never to collide.
10524:
  text: |-
    It was 8:43 PM, and the time approached when Harry's Time-Turner would open, to
    be tested in the one way that no imaginable spell could fool, unless that spell
    could bypass the laws of Time itself. No body or soul, no knowledge or
    substance, could stretch an extra seven hours in a single day. She would make up
    a message on the spot, and tell Harry to take that message back six hours to
    Professor Flitwick at 3PM, and she would ask Professor Flitwick if he had
    received it in that hour.
10525:
  text: |-
    And Professor Flitwick would tell her that he had indeed received it at 3PM.
10526:
  text: |-
    And she would tell Severus and Albus to have a <em>little</em> more faith in
    Harry next time.
10527:
  text: |-
    Professor McGonagall cast the Patronus Charm, and told her shining cat, "Go to
    Mr. Potter, and tell him this: Mr. Potter, please come to my office as soon as
    you hear this, without doing anything else along the way."
