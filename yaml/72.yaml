    The winter Sun had well set by the time dinner ended, and so it was amid the
    peaceful light of stars twinkling down from the enchanted ceiling of the Great
    Hall that Hermione left for the Ravenclaw Tower alongside her study partner
    Harry Potter, who lately seemed to have a <em>ridiculous</em> amount of time for
    studying. She hadn't the faintest idea of when Harry was doing his actual
    homework, except that it was getting done, maybe by house elves while he slept.
12190:
  text: |-
    Nearly every single pair of eyes in the whole Hall lay on them as they passed
    through the mighty doors of the dining-room, which were more like siege gates of
    a castle than anything students ought to go through on the way back from supper.
12191:
  text: |-
    They went out without speaking, and walked until the distant babble of student
    conversation had faded into silence; and then the two of them went on a little
    further through the stone corridors before Hermione finally spoke.
12192:
  text: |-
    "Why'd you do that, Harry?"
12193:
  text: |-
    "Do what?" said the Boy-Who-Lived in an abstracted tone, as if his mind were
    quite elsewhere, thinking about vastly more important things.
12194:
  text: |-
    "I mean, why didn't you just <em>tell</em> them no?"
12195:
  text: |-
    "Well," Harry said, as their shoes pattered across the tiles, "I can't just go
    around saying 'no' every time someone asks me about something I haven't done. I
    mean, suppose someone asks me, 'Harry, did you pull the prank with the invisible
    paint?' and I say 'No' and then they say 'Harry, do you know who messed with the
    Gryffindor Seeker's broomstick?' and I say 'I refuse to answer that question.'
    It's sort of a giveaway."
12196:
  text: |-
    "And <em>that's</em> why," Hermione said carefully, "you told everyone..." She
    concentrated, rembering the exact words. "That if hypothetically there
    <em>was</em> a conspiracy, you could not confirm or deny that the true master of
    the conspiracy was Salazar Slytherin's ghost, and in fact you wouldn't even be
    able to admit the conspiracy existed so people ought to stop asking you
    questions about it."
12197:
  text: |-
    "Yep," said Harry Potter, smiling slightly. "That'll teach them to take
    hypothetical scenarios too seriously."
12198:
  text: |-
    "And you told <em>me</em> not to answer anything -"
12199:
  text: |-
    "They might not <em>believe</em> you, if you deny it," said Harry. "So it's
    better to say nothing, unless you want them to think you're a liar."
12200:
  text: |-
    "But -" Hermione said helplessly. "But - but now people think I'm <em>doing</em>
    things for <em>Salazar Slytherin!</em> " The way the Gryffindors had been
    looking at her - the way the <em>Slytherins</em> had been looking at her -
12201:
  text: |-
    "It goes along with being a hero," Harry said. "Have you seen what the
    <em>Quibbler</em> says about <em>me?</em> "
12202:
  text: |-
    For a brief second Hermione imagined her parents reading a newspaper article
    about her, and instead of the story being about her winning a nationwide
    spelling bee or any of the other ways she'd imagined getting into the papers,
    the headline said "HERMIONE GRANGER GETS DRACO MALFOY PREGNANT".
12203:
  text: |-
    It was enough to make you think twice about the whole heroine business.
12204:
  text: |-
    Harry's voice turned a bit more formal. "Speaking of which, Miss Granger, how
    goes your latest quest?"
12205:
  text: |-
    "Well," said Hermione, "unless the ghost of Salazar Slytherin really
    <em>does</em> show up and tell us where to find bullies, I don't think we're
    going to have much luck." Not that she was sorry about that.
12206:
  text: |-
    She glanced over at Harry, and saw the boy giving her a peculiarly intense look.
12207:
  text: |-
    "You know, Hermione," the boy said quietly, as though to make sure that nobody
    else in the world heard, "I think you're right. I think some people get a lot
    more help than others in becoming heroes. And <em>I</em> don't think that's
    fair, either."
12208:
  text: |-
    And Harry grabbed at her witch's robes where they lay over her arm, and hustled
    her into a side-hall of the corridor they were walking through, her mouth gaping
    open in surprise even as Harry's wand came into his hand, they rounded a curve
    of the side-hall and it was so narrow that it was almost pushing her and Harry
    into each other, even as Harry pointed to the way they'd come and softly said
    "<em>Quietus</em>", then a moment later, in the other direction,
    "<em>Quietus</em>" again.
12209:
  text: |-
    The boy looked searchingly around them, not just to every side, but even upward
    toward the ceiling and down toward the floor.
12210:
  text: |-
    And then Harry stuck a hand in his pouch and said, "Invisibility cloak."
12211:
  text: |-
    "<em>Gleep?</em> " said Hermione.
12212:
  text: |-
    Harry was already drawing out folds of shimmering black fabric from the mokeskin
    device. "Don't worry," the boy said with a small grin, "they're so rare that
    nobody bothered to make a school rule against them..."
12213:
  text: |-
    And then Harry held out the dark velvet mesh to her, and said, his voice
    strangely formal, "I do not give you, but loan you, my cloak, unto Hermione Jean
    Granger. Protect her well."
12214:
  text: |-
    She stared at the shimmering velvet of the cloak, cloth that swallowed all the
    light that fell on it except what glinted from small strange reflections, fabric
    so perfectly black it should've shown dust or lint or <em>something</em> but it
    didn't, the longer you looked the more you felt like what you were seeing wasn't
    really there at all, but then you blinked again and it was just a black cloak.
12215:
  text: |-
    "Take it, Hermione."
12216:
  text: |-
    Hardly even thinking, Hermione stretched out her hand to grasp the fabric; and
    then just as her brain woke up and she started to pull her hand back, Harry let
    go of the cloak and it started to fall and she grabbed at it without thinking.
    And the instant her fingers touched and held the cloak she felt an intangible
    jolt run through her like picking up her wand for the first time; and it was
    like she heard a song being sung, ever so faintly, in the back of her mind.
12217:
  text: |-
    "That's one of my quest items, Hermione," Harry said softly. "It belonged to my
    father, and it's not something I can replace, if it's lost. Don't loan it to
    anyone else, don't show it to anyone, don't tell anyone it exists... but if you
    want to borrow it for a while, just come to me and ask."
12218:
  text: |-
    Hermione finally tore her eyes loose from the depthless black folds and stared
    back up at Harry.
12219:
  text: |-
    "I can't -"
12220:
  text: |-
    "You certainly can," Harry said. "Because there's nothing even the tiniest bit
    fair about my finding this gift-wrapped in a box next to my bed one morning, and
    you... not." Harry paused thoughtfully. "Unless you <em>did</em> get your own
    invisibility cloak, in which case never mind."
12221:
  text: |-
    Then the implications of <em>invisibility cloak</em> finally dawned on her, and
    she pointed a shocked finger at Harry, though they were close enough together
    that she couldn't quite straighten her arm properly, and her voice rose with
    considerable indignation as she said, "So <em>that's</em> how you disappeared
    from the Potions closet! And the time when -" and then she trailed off, because
    even <em>with</em> an invisibility cloak she still couldn't see how Harry had...
12222:
  text: |-
    Harry buffed his fingernails on his robes with artful nonchalance, and said,
    "Well, you knew there had to be <em>some</em> trick to it, right? And now the
    heroine will mysteriously know where and when to find bullies - just like she
    listened to the bullies planning it, even though nobody her age could
    <em>possibly</em> have turned herself invisible to spy on them."
12223:
  text: |-
    There was a pause and a silence.
12224:
  text: |-
    "Harry -" she said. "I'm - I'm not sure anymore that fighting bullies is such a
    good idea."
12225:
  text: |-
    Harry's eyes stayed steady on hers. "Because the other girls might get hurt?"
12226:
  text: |-
    She nodded, just nodded.
12227:
  text: |-
    "That's <em>their</em> choice, Hermione, just like it's yours. <em>I</em>
    decided not to do the obvious stupid thing that everyone does in books, try to
    keep you safe and protected and helpless, and have you get really angry at me,
    and push me away while you go off on your own and get into even more trouble,
    and then heroically pull through it successfully, after which I'd finally have
    my epiphany and realize that blah blah blah etcetera. I know how that part of my
    life story goes, so I'm just skipping over it. If I can predict what I'm going
    to think later, I might as well go ahead and think it now. Anyway, my point is,
    you shouldn't smother <em>your</em> friends to keep them safe, either. Just tell
    them up front it's predictably going to go horribly wrong, and if they still
    want to be heroines after that, fine."
12228:
  text: |-
    It was at times like this that Hermione wondered if she was <em>ever</em> going
    to get used to the way Harry thought. "Harry, I really," her voice stuck for a
    second, "really, <em>really</em> don't want them getting hurt! Especially
    because of something I started!"
12229:
  text: |-
    "Hermione," Harry said seriously, "I'm pretty sure you did the right thing. I
    don't see what could realistically happen to them that would be <em>worse</em>
    for them, in the long run, than <em>not trying</em>."
12230:
  text: |-
    "What if they get <em>badly</em> hurt?" Hermione said. Her voice felt blocked in
    her throat; she remembered Captain Ernie saying how Harry had just stared
    straight into the eyes of a bully as the bully bent his finger back, before
    Professor Sprout had arrived to save him; and there was another thought that
    came after that, about Hannah and her delicate hands with the fingernails that
    she carefully painted in Hufflepuff yellow every morning, but that wasn't
    allowed to be imagined. "And then - they'll never do anything courageous, ever
    again -"
12231:
  text: |-
    "I don't think it works like that," Harry said steadily. "Even if it all goes
    mind-bogglingly wrong, I don't think it works like that inside a human mind. The
    important thing is believing about yourself that you're someone who can break
    your boundaries. Trying and getting hurt can't possibly be worse for you than
    being... <em>stuck</em>."
12232:
  text: |-
    "What if you're <em>wrong,</em> Harry?"
12233:
  text: |-
    Harry paused for a moment, and then shrugged a little sadly, and said, "What if
    I'm right?"
12234:
  text: |-
    Hermione looked back at the black mesh running over her hand. From the inside
    the cloak felt strangely soft and yet firm against her palm, as if it was trying
    to give her hand a reassuring hug.
12235:
  text: |-
    Then she lifted her arm back up, holding the cloak back to Harry.
12236:
  text: |-
    Harry didn't move to take it.
12237:
  text: |-
    "I -" said Hermione. "I mean, thank you, thank you a lot, but I'm still thinking
    about it, so you can take it back for now. And... Harry, I don't think it's
    right to <em>spy</em> on people -"
12238:
  text: |-
    "Not even on known bullies, to rescue their victims?" Harry said. "<em>I've</em>
    never been bullied, but I've been through a realistic simulation, and it didn't
    feel very pleasant. Have you ever been bullied, Hermione?"
12239:
  text: |-
    "No," she said in a quiet voice, and went on holding out Harry's invisibility
    cloak to him.
12240:
  text: |-
    Finally Harry took back his cloak - she felt a small twitch of loss as the
    inaudible song vanished from the back of her mind - and started to stuff the
    black material back into his pouch.
12241:
  text: |-
    As the pouch ate the last of the fabric, Harry turned from her, to break the
    Quieting Barrier -
12242:
  text: |-
    "And, um," Hermione said. "That's not <em>the</em> Cloak of Invisibility, is it?
    The one we read about in the library on page eighteen of Paula Vieira's
    translation of Gottschalk's <em>An Illustrated Scroll of Lost Devices</em>?"
12243:
  text: |-
    Harry turned his head back, grinning slightly, and said in exactly the same tone
    of voice he'd used earlier with the other students at dinner, "I cannot confirm
    or deny that I possess magical artifacts of incredible power."
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
12244:
  text: |-
    When Hermione climbed into bed that night she was still trying to decide. Her
    life had been simpler at dinnertime, back when there hadn't <em>been</em> any
    practical way for them to find bullies; and now she had to choose again; not for
    herself, this time, but for her friends. In her mind's eye she kept seeing
    Dumbledore's lined face and the pain it hadn't quite hidden, and in her mind's
    ears she kept hearing Harry's voice saying 'That's their choice, Hermione, just
    like it's yours.'
12245:
  text: |-
    And her hand kept remembering the sensation of the cloak against her fingers,
    replaying it over and over in her mind. There was a power to the feeling that
    compelled her thoughts to return to it, and to the song she'd heard / hadn't
    heard in a part of her mind and magic which now lay silent once more.
12246:
  text: |-
    Harry had spoken to the cloak like it was a <em>person</em>, telling it to take
    good care of her. Harry had said the cloak had belonged to his father, that he
    couldn't replace it if it was lost...
12247:
  text: |-
    But... Harry wouldn't <em>really</em> do that, would he?
12248:
  text: |-
    Just <em>hand</em> her one of the three Deathly Hallows created centuries before
    Hogwarts?
12249:
  text: |-
    She could say that she felt flattered, but this went <em>way</em> beyond feeling
    flattered, into making her wonder just what she was to Harry, exactly.
12250:
  text: |-
    Maybe Harry was the sort of person who went around loaning ancient lost magical
    artifacts to <em>anyone</em> he considered a friend, but -
12251:
  text: |-
    But when she thought about <em>which</em> part of his life Harry had said he'd
    skipped over, the part where he tried to keep her safe and protected...
12252:
  text: |-
    Hermione stared up at the ceiling of the Ravenclaw dorm. Somewhere beyond her
    bed, Mandy and Su were talking. She'd turned up her Quieting Charm to where she
    couldn't hear the exact words, but could still hear their faint murmur; there
    was something comforting about sleeping in a dorm with the other girls. Harry
    kept his own Quieter turned up all the way, she knew.
12253:
  text: |-
    She was starting to wonder if maybe Harry actually <em>did</em>, well...
12254:
  text: |-
    You know...
12255:
  text: |-
    <em>Like</em> her.
12256:
  text: |-
    It took Hermione Granger a long time to fall asleep that night.
12257:
  text: |-
    And when she woke up the next morning there was a small slip of parchment
    peeking out from under her pillow which said <em>At half-past ten you will find
    a bully in the fourth passageway to the left of the hall leaving the Potions
    classroom - S.</em>
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
12258:
  text: |-
    When Hermione entered the Great Hall that morning, her stomach was filled with
    flying butterflies the size of Hippogriffs; even as she approached the Ravenclaw
    breakfast table she still hadn't decided what to <em>do.</em>
12259:
  text: |-
    There was an empty place next to Padma, she saw. That would be where to sit
    down, if she was going to tell Padma and then ask Padma to tell Daphne and
    Tracey.
12260:
  text: |-
    Hermione walked toward the empty place next to Padma.
12261:
  text: |-
    There were words waiting in her throat, <em>Padma, I got a</em>
    <em>mysterious</em> <em>message -</em>
12262:
  text: |-
    And she could feel a huge brick wall inside her, stopping the words from coming
    out. She'd be putting Hannah and Susan and Daphne <em>in danger</em>. Taking
    them and leading them by the hand straight into trouble. That was Wrong.
12263:
  text: |-
    Or she could just go try to handle the bully herself, without telling her
    friends anything, and that, quite obviously, was also Wrong.
12264:
  text: |-
    Hermione knew she was being faced with a Moral Dilemma, just like all those
    wizards and witches she'd read about in stories. Only in stories people always
    got a <em>right</em> choice and a wrong choice, not two wrong ones, which seemed
    a bit unfair. But she had the sense, somehow - maybe it came from the way Harry
    always talked about how the history books would see them - that she was faced
    with a Heroic Decision, and that her whole life might end up going one way or
    another, depending on what she chose right now, <em>this morning</em>.
12265:
  text: |-
    Hermione sat down at the table without looking to either side, just gazing at
    the plate and silverware like they might have answers hidden inside, thinking as
    hard as she ever had, and a few seconds later she heard Padma's voice whispering
    almost in her ear, "Daphne says she knows where a bully's going to be at ten-
    thirty today."
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
12266:
  text: |-
    Doomed.
12267:
  text: |-
    They were all doomed, in Susan Bones's opinion.
12268:
  text: |-
    Auntie sometimes told stories which started out like this, people doing
    something they <em>knew</em> was stupid, and the stories usually ended with
    someone being <em>doomed</em> all over the floor and all over the walls and
    getting on Auntie's shoes.
12269:
  text: |-
    "Hey, Padma," muttered Parvati, her voice just barely audible over the soft
    impacts of eight girls tiptoeing through the corridor leading to the Potions
    classroom, "d'you know why Hermione's been sighing all morning -"
12270:
  text: |-
    "No talking!" hissed Lavender, the harsh whisper sounding much louder than
    Parvati's mutter. "You never know when Evil might be listening!"
12271:
  text: |-
    <em>"Shhh!</em> " said three other girls even more loudly.
12272:
  text: |-
    Utterly, totally, quite extremely doomed.
12273:
  text: |-
    As they approached the fourth passageway to the left of the Potions classroom,
    where Daphne's mysterious informant had said the bullying would take place, the
    eight of them moved slower, the sound of their feet got softer, and finally
    General Granger made the gesture that meant <em>Halt, I'll look ahead</em>.
12274:
  text: |-
    Lavender raised a hand, then, and when Hermione turned to look at her, Lavender,
    looking puzzled, pointed straight down the corridor, gestured to herself, and
    then tried to sign something else that Susan didn't understand -
12275:
  text: |-
    General Granger shook her head, and once again, this time with slower, more
    exaggerated movements, made the sign for <em>Halt, I'll look ahead</em>.
12276:
  text: |-
    Lavender, looking even more puzzled, pointed back the way they'd come, and made
    a bouncing gesture with her other hand.
12277:
  text: |-
    Now everyone else was looking even more confused than Lavender, and Susan
    thought with some acerbity that evidently one hour of practice done two days ago
    wasn't enough to remember a new set of code signals.
12278:
  text: |-
    Hermione pointed at Lavender, then at the floor beneath Lavender's feet, the
    expression on her face making it very clear that the intended meaning was
    <em>You. Stay. Here.</em>
12279:
  text: |-
    Lavender nodded.
12280:
  text: |-
    <em>Doom doom doom,</em> went the words of the Chaos Legion's marching song
    through Susan's mind, <em>doom doom doom doom doom doom</em>...
12281:
  text: |-
    Hermione reached into her robes, and drew out a little rod with a mirror on the
    end of it and an eyepiece. Very very softly indeed, the Ravenclaw girl crept up
    to the wall, right next to where the passageway opened off the corridor, and
    peeked just the tip of the eyepiece around the corner.
12282:
  text: |-
    Then a little more.
12283:
  text: |-
    Then a little more.
12284:
  text: |-
    Then General Granger cautiously stuck her head around the side.
12285:
  text: |-
    General Granger turned back to them, nodded, and made the hand gesture for
    <em>follow me</em>.
12286:
  text: |-
    Susan felt a little better as she crept forward. The part of the Plan which
    called for them to arrive thirty minutes before the bully had, apparently,
    actually worked. Maybe they were only <em>slightly</em> doomed...?
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
12287:
  text: |-
    At ten-twenty-nine, almost on the dot, the bully showed up. If anyone had been
    present to hear - though the corridor was apparently empty - they would have
    heard his shoes clicking solidly through the main corridor, entering the
    passageway, walking toward where the passageway turned its first corner, turning
    that corner, and then stopping in some surprise upon seeing that the passageway
    now terminated in a solid brick wall where no wall had been before.
12288:
  text: |-
    Then the bully shrugged and turned away, as he leaned back to watch the main
    passage from just around the corner.
12289:
  text: |-
    It <em>was</em> the castle Hogwarts, after all.
12290:
  text: |-
    Behind the hastily Transfigured thin panels they'd assembled into the outward
    appearance of a brick wall, the girls waited; not speaking, not moving, hardly
    even breathing, but watching through the eyeholes they'd left themselves.
12291:
  text: |-
    As Susan's gaze took in the bully, she could feel the tightening of her chest
    all the way into her toes. The boy looked to be in his seventh-year if not
    <em>older</em>, and his robes were trimmed in green instead of the red they'd
    been hoping for, and he had <em>muscles</em>, and after staring for a bit
    longer, Susan realized his stance had the balance that meant that he
    <em>dueled</em>.
12292:
  text: |-
    Then they all heard the sound of more feet approaching from the corridor. The
    fourth-year Gryffindors and Slytherins had just been let out of Potions class.
12293:
  text: |-
    The footsteps pattered past, and diminished and faded, and the bully didn't do
    anything. For a moment Susan felt an instant of relief -
12294:
  text: |-
    Then another, smaller group of footsteps approached.
12295:
  text: |-
    The bully still didn't do anything, as the footsteps went past.
12296:
  text: |-
    That happened a few more times.
12297:
  text: |-
    And then, as there approached the faintly audible sound of one last set of
    footsteps, the seven girls heard the bully's voice saying, clear and cold and
    quiet, "<em>Protego</em>".
12298:
  text: |-
    Someone <em>did</em> gasp then, though fortunately very very quietly. If they
    couldn't get in even a single shot -
12299:
  text: |-
    The bullies were learning <em>already</em>, Susan realized, she hadn't expected
    S.P.H.E.W. to be able to do this very often before the bullies caught on - but -
    Hermione had already defeated three bullies - and the school had been buzzing
    with speculation about Salazar Slytherin's ghost, yesterday -
12300:
  text: |-
    <em>He's expecting us!</em>
12301:
  text: |-
    Susan would have whispered to give up, to abort the plan, only there was no way
    to convey a message to -
12302:
  text: |-
    "<em>Silencio</em>," said the bully in a soft, deliberate voice with his wand
    pointed toward the corridor, the blue haze of his Shielding Charm shimmering
    around him. "<em>Accio</em> victim."
12303:
  text: |-
    When the fourth-year boy came into their field of vision he was dangling upside
    down as if an invisible hand were holding him high by one leg, his red-trimmed
    robes beginning to slide down his thighs to reveal the pants beneath. His mouth

    "I suppose you're wondering what's going on," the seventh-year Slytherin said in
    a quiet, cold voice. "Don't worry. It's so simple even a Gryffindor could
    understand."
12305:
  text: |-
    With that, the Slytherin's left hand formed a fist and drove hard into the
    Gryffindor's belly. The fourth-year boy's body jerked around frantically, but
    still no words left his mouth.
12306:
  text: |-
    "You're my victim," said the older Slytherin. "I'm a bully. I'm going to beat
    you up. And we'll see if anyone stops me."
12307:
  text: |-
    It was at that moment that Susan realized it was a trap.
12308:
  text: |-
    And in almost the same moment, there rang out the mighty and high-pitched voice
    of a young girl, crying, "<em>Stop, evildoer! Finite Incantatem!</em> "
12309:
  text: |-
    <em>Lavender</em>, thought Susan, agonized. The Gryffindor girl had volunteered
    to be a distraction, while the rest of them executed a flank attack from where
    the bully wouldn't expect it, that had been the plan, only now -
12310:
  text: |-
    "In the name of Hogwarts," cried Lavender's voice, though they couldn't see her,
    "and in the name of heroines everywhere, I command you to let go of that EEK!"
12311:
  text: |-
    "<em>Expelliarmus</em>," said the bully. "<em>Stupefy</em>. <em>Accio</em>
    stupid heroine."
12312:
  text: |-
    When Lavender floated into their vision, dangling by one foot and unconscious,
    Susan blinked; the girl was dressed in a bright crimson-and-gold skirt and
    blouse, instead of her usual Hogwarts robes.
12313:
  text: |-
    The bully was also giving the girl's upside-down body an odd look, and then he
    pointed his wand at her and said "<em>Finite Incantatem</em>," but the clothes
    stayed the same.
12314:
  text: |-
    Then the bully shrugged, and, still facing in the direction of Lavender instead
    of the dangling fourth-year boy, drew back his fist -
12315:
  text: |-
    "<em>Lagann!</em> " yelled five voices, and five green spirals blasted from five
    wands aimed through five holes in the false wall, and an instant later
    Hermione's voice shouted "<em>Stupefy!</em> "
12316:
  text: |-
    Five green spirals shattered ineffectually on blue haze, and Hermione's red bolt
    bounced off the haze and struck the fourth-year boy, who jerked and then was
    still.
12317:
  text: |-
    And the seventh-year bully turned around, smiling grimly, as the first-year
    girls screamed and charged.

    Susan's eyes flew open and instantly she was rolling away from where she'd lain
    on the floor, her lungs still on fire and her whole body still aching from when
    she'd been hit, the battle had only moved forward a few seconds from what she
    could see, Hannah's body falling with her arm still stretched out toward Susan,
    "<em>Glisseo!</em> " shouted Hermione but the older boy just slashed his wand
    down leaving a trail of green glow behind and Hermione's Charm visibly disrupted
    into a shower of blue-white sparks, then in almost the same motion the bully
    said "<em>Stupefy!</em> " and Hermione was blown backward and Susan summoned up
    all the magic she had left and shouted "<em>Innervate!</em> " at Hermione's body
    even as the bully turned toward her, the bully's wand pointed in her direction
    again and then Padma yelled "<em>Prismatis!</em> " just before the bully shouted
    "<em>Impedimenta!</em> ", the rainbow sphere forming <em>around the bully</em>
    and the seventh-year Slytherin staggered as his own hex was reflected back at
    him, but an instant later the bully's wand swept back to tap himself and then
    Padma's Prismatic Sphere shattered like a blown soap bubble as the bully's wand
    cut through it and "<em>Innervate!</em> " yelled Parvati at Hannah's body and
    Tracey and Lavender screamed at the same time, "<em>Wingardium Leviosa!</em> " -

    Hannah Abbott held out her wand with a hand that trembled with exhaustion, she
    didn't have enough magic left for even one <em>Innervate</em>, now.
12320:
  text: |-
    The rest of the passageway was silent, scattered bodies lying across the ground,
    Padma and Tracey and Lavender, Hermione and Parvati in a heap against one wall,
    Susan standing in petrified rigor as her eyes tracked it all helplessly, even
    the Gryffindor boy lying sprawled and motionless (Hermione had woken him and
    he'd fought, but it hadn't been enough).
12321:
  text: |-
    It had been a very short battle.
12322:
  text: |-
    The bully was still smiling, the only signs of his exertion a wavering ripple in
    the blue glow surrounding him, and a few beads of sweat on his forehead.
12323:
  text: |-
    The bully raised his arm, wiped the sweat off his forehead, and stalked toward
    her like a man-shaped living Lethifold.
12324:
  text: |-
    Hannah turned and fled, spun and ran with screams kept bound in her choking
    throat, sprinted past the fallen paneling of the fake brick wall, ran down the
    passageway with all the speed she could muster, weaving as much as she could -
12325:
  text: |-
    Just before Hannah got to the turn in the passageway, the bully's voice from
    behind her said "<em>Cluthe!</em> " and she got awful cramps all through her
    legs, she fell down and slid and hit her head against the wall, only she didn't
    even notice the pain of the smack as she started to scream with the twisting
    muscles -
12326:
  text: |-
    The bully was still stalking toward her, Hannah saw as she turned her head;
    approaching her slowly, still wearing that dreadful smile.
12327:
  text: |-
    And she rolled, despite the pain as her leg muscles knotted up around
    themselves, she rolled around the corner of the passageway, and screamed, "Go
    <em>away!</em> "
12328:
  text: |-
    "I think not," said the bully, his voice deep and scary like that of a grown
    man, sounding very close at hand now.
12329:
  text: |-
    The bully walked around the corner and Daphne Greengrass stabbed her Most
    Ancient Blade directly into his groin.
12330:
  text: |-
    There was a flash that lit up the whole corridor -
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
12331:
  text: |-
    It was with a subdued mien that seven girls left Madam Pomfrey's office, leaving
    one of their own behind in a hospital bed.
12332:
  text: |-
    Hannah would be all right in about thirty-five minutes, the healer had said;
    torn muscles were easy to mend.
12333:
  text: |-
    Daphne had done all the talking, and according to her, Hannah had suffered a
    mishap with a Road-Running Charm which had caused the leg cramps. Madam Pomfrey
    had given them a sharp look but hadn't argued, even though that Charm was around
    six years above their level.
12334:
  text: |-
    Madam Pomfrey had also given Daphne a potion to help with her state of total
    magical exhaustion, and warned her not to cast any spells for the next three
    hours. That, supposedly, was from Daphne using up too much magic trying to
    <em>Finite</em> Hannah, rather than the Most Ancient Blade drawing out all of
    her power to break the <em>Protego</em>.
12335:
  text: |-
    The rest of them had decided not to say anything about the bruises under their
    robes until they could get some older girls to cast <em>Episkey</em>. There were
    limits to what Daphne could talk around.
12336:
  text: |-
    The whole thing, Susan thought, had been too close, much too close. If the bully
    had so much as looked around the corner - if he'd taken a moment to recast his
    Shielding Charm -
12337:
  text: |-
    "We should stop," said Susan, as soon as the seven of them had gotten out of
    hearing range of the healer's office. "We should stop doing this."
12338:
  text: |-
    For some reason, then, even though they were supposed to vote on this sort of
    thing, everyone turned to look at General Granger.
12339:
  text: |-
    The Sunshine General didn't seem to see them looking at her, she just strode on,
    gazing off straight ahead.
12340:
  text: |-
    After a little while, Hermione Granger said, in a voice that sounded thoughtful
    and a little sad, "Hannah said <em>she</em> didn't want us to stop. I'm not sure
    it's right for us to... be less brave <em>for</em> her, than she is."
12341:
  text: |-
    All the other girls, except Susan, nodded at that.
12342:
  text: |-
    "I think that's got to be as bad as it gets," said Parvati. "And we can handle
    it. We've proved that now."
12343:
  text: |-
    Susan couldn't think of anything to say to that. She didn't think that shrieking
    at the top of her lungs about blatant stupidity and DOOM would be persuasive.
    And she couldn't just <em>leave</em> the other girls, either. Wasn't it enough
    to be cursed with hard work, why did Hufflepuffs have to be <em>loyal</em> on
    top of everything else?
12344:
  text: |-
    "By the way, Lavender," said Padma. "What in the name of Merlin's underpants
    were you <em>wearing</em> back there?"
12345:
  text: |-
    "My hero outfit," said the Gryffindor girl.
12346:
  text: |-
    Daphne sounded weary, as she spoke without turning her own head from where she
    was plodding through the hall. "It's the costume of the Soldier of Gryffindor
    from the play <em>Chronicles of the Lunarian Soldiers</em>."
12347:
  text: |-
    "Did you Transfigure it?" said Parvati, looking puzzled. "But the bully cast
    <em>Finite</em> on you -"
12348:
  text: |-
    "Nope!" Lavender said. "It's <em>real!</em> See, I just Transfigured my hero
    outfit into a regular shirt and skirt <em>beforehand</em>, so all I had to do
    was cast <em>Finite</em> on myself after I saw the bully. Do you want your own,
    Parvati? I got mine made yesterday by Katarina and Joshua in sixth-year, for
    twelve Sickles -"
12349:
  text: |-
    "I think," General Granger said in a careful voice, "that would make us all look
    a little silly."
12350:
  text: |-
    "Well," said Lavender, "we should vote on whether to -"
12351:
  text: |-
    "I think," General Granger said, "that no matter what <em>anyone</em> votes, I'm
    not going to be caught <em>dead</em> wearing one of those costumes -"
12352:
  text: |-
    Susan ignored the argument. She was trying to think up some sort of clever
    strategy for being less doomed.

    The whole Great Hall went silent, even if only for a moment, as the seven of
    them walked into lunch.
12354:
  text: |-
    Then the applause started.
12355:
  text: |-
    It was scattered, not the massive applause of everyone applauding at once. A lot
    of it came from the Gryffindor table, less from Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw, and
    none from Slytherin.
12356:
  text: |-
    Daphne felt her face tightening. She'd <em>hoped</em> - well, maybe after they
    found a Gryffindor bully to stop and a Slytherin to rescue, her fellow
    Slytherins would realize -
12357:
  text: |-
    She looked at the Hufflepuff table.
12358:
  text: |-
    Neville Longbottom was applauding with his hands held high above his head,
    although he wasn't smiling. Maybe he'd heard about Hannah, or maybe he was
    wondering why Hannah wasn't there.
12359:
  text: |-
    Then, not quite able to help herself, she glanced toward the Head Table.
12360:
  text: |-
    Professor Sprout's face was lined with concern. She and Professor McGonagall
    were leaning their heads toward Headmaster Dumbledore, who had a solemn look,
    and all their lips were moving quickly. Professor Flitwick looked more resigned
    than anything else, and Quirrell, face slack, was taking trembling stabs at his
    soup using a spoon gripped in a fist.
12361:
  text: |-
    Professor Snape was looking directly at -
12362:
  text: |-
    <em>Her?</em>
12363:
  text: |-
    Or - at Hermione Granger, standing next to her?
12364:
  text: |-
    A small, thin smile crossed the Potions Master's face, and he raised his hands,
    brought them together once in a motion that was too slow to be a real clap; and
    then the Potions Master turned back to his plate, ignoring the conversations
    around him.
12365:
  text: |-
    Daphne felt a little chill go down her spine, and she hastily turned to walk
    toward the Slytherin table. Susan and Lavender and Parvati peeled off from their
    group, heading toward the Hufflepuff and Gryffindor tables on the other side of
    the Great Hall.
12366:
  text: |-
    It happened as they were passing the part of the Slytherin table where the
    Slytherin Quidditch team sat.
12367:
  text: |-
    That was when Hermione stumbled suddenly, stumbled <em>hard</em> like she was
    being yanked off her feet, and went sprawling into the gap between where Marcus
    Flint and Lucian Bole sat, and there was a sad little splutching sound as
    Hermione's face ended up in Flint's plate of steak and mashed potatoes.
12368:
  text: |-
    Everything seemed to happen too quickly then, or maybe it was just Daphne
    herself who was thinking too slow, as Flint let out a bellow of indignation and
    his hand yanked Hermione back and threw her into the Ravenclaw table, and she
    bounced off a student's back and collapsed onto the ground -
12369:
  text: |-
    The quiet spread out in ripples.
12370:
  text: |-
    Hermione pushed herself up on her hands, though she didn't get all the way to
    her feet, Daphne could see that her whole body was shaking, and that her face
    was still covered with mashed potatoes with scattered pieces of steak.
12371:
  text: |-
    For a long moment, nobody spoke, nobody moved. Like nobody in the whole Great
    Hall could imagine, any more than Daphne could, what happened next.
12372:
  text: |-
    Then Flint's powerful voice, the voice of the Slytherin Captain that bellowed
    commands on the Quidditch pitch, said in a dangerous rumble, "You ruined my
    food, girl."
12373:
  text: |-
    Another moment of frozen silence. Hermione's head - Daphne could see it
    trembling - turned to look at the Slytherin Quidditch Captain.
12374:
  text: |-
    "Apologize to me," said Flint.
12375:
  text: |-
    Harry Potter started to push himself up from the Ravenclaw table, and then
    stopped abruptly, halfway to his feet, as if he'd just thought of something -
12376:
  text: |-
    Then five other people stood up from the Ravenclaw table.
12377:
  text: |-
    All of the Slytherin Quidditch team stood up, their wands coming into their
    hands, and then students stood up at the Gryffindor table and at the Hufflepuff
    table and without thinking Daphne turned to look at the Head Table and she saw
    that the Headmaster was still sitting down, watching, just watching, Dumbledore
    was <em>just watching</em> and he had one hand out as though to restrain
    Professor McGonagall - in just one second someone would shout a spell and then
    it would be too late, <em>why wasn't the Headmaster doing anything</em> -
12378:
  text: |-
    And a voice said, "My apologies."
12379:
  text: |-
    Daphne turned back to look, her mouth gaping open in absolute shock.
12380:
  text: |-
    "<em>Scourgify</em>," said that smooth voice, and the mashed potatoes vanished
    from Hermione's face, revealing the Ravenclaw's surprised expression as Draco
    Malfoy approached her, sheathed his wand again, and then knelt to one knee
    beside her and offered her a hand.
12381:
  text: |-
    "Sorry about that, Miss Granger," said Draco Malfoy's polite voice. "I guess
    someone thought they were being funny."
12382:
  text: |-
    Hermione took Draco's hand, and Daphne suddenly realized what was about to
    happen -
12383:
  text: |-
    But Draco Malfoy <em>didn't</em> raise Hermione halfway up and then drop her.
12384:
  text: |-
    He just pulled her to her feet.
12385:
  text: |-
    "Thanks," said Hermione.
12386:
  text: |-
    "You're welcome," Draco Malfoy said in a loud voice, not looking to either side
    to see where all four Houses of Hogwarts were staring at him in total shock.
    "Just remember, being cunning and ambitious doesn't mean you have to be like
    that."
12387:
  text: |-
    And then Draco Malfoy went back to his seat at the Slytherin bench and sat down
    like he hadn't - he hadn't just - <em>he'd just</em> -
12388:
  text: |-
    Hermione went to the nearest empty place at the Ravenclaw bench and sat down.
12389:
  text: |-
    A number of other people, rather slowly, sat down.
12390:
  text: |-
    "Daphne?" said Tracey. "Are you all right?"
  draw-line-after-paragraph: true
12391:
  text: |-
    Draco's heart was hammering in his chest so hard he worried it might explode
    right out of his chest in a shower of blood, like that curse Amycus Carrow had
    used once on a puppy.
12392:
  text: |-
    Draco's face stayed completely controlled, because he knew (it'd been drilled
    into him over and over) that if he showed the slightest sign of the fear he was
    feeling, his Housemates would rip him apart like a swarm of Acromantulas.
12393:
  text: |-
    There'd been no time to check with Harry Potter, no time to plot, no time to
    think, just the instant of realizing that the time to start rescuing Slytherin's
    reputation was <em>right then</em>.
12394:
  text: |-
    From all sides of the long Slytherin table, angry faces stared at Draco.
12395:
  text: |-
    But they were outnumbered by the faces that just looked puzzled.
12396:
  text: |-
    "All right, I give up," said a sixth-year boy that Draco didn't recognize,
    sitting across from him and two places to his right. "Why did you do that,
    Malfoy?"
12397:
  text: |-
    Although his mouth was very dry, Draco didn't swallow. That would have been a
    sign of fear. Instead he took a bite of carrots, which had the most moisture of
    anything on his plate, and chewed and swallowed, thinking as rapidly as he
    could.
12398:
  text: |-
    "You know," Draco said, making his voice as cutting as he could - as his heart
    thumped even harder in his chest, as everyone around him stopped talking to
    listen - "there's <em>probably</em> some way to make Slytherin look even
    <em>worse</em> than attacking eight first-year girls from all four Houses who
    are working together to stop bullies, but I can't think of <em>how</em>. This
    way we get the benefit of what Greengrass is doing."
12399:
  text: |-
    The puzzled faces stayed puzzled.
12400:
  text: |-
    "What?" said the sixth-year boy, and "Wait, <em>what</em> benefit?" said a
    fifth-year girl sitting to his right.
12401:
  text: |-
    "It makes Slytherin House look better," said Draco.
12402:
  text: |-
    The Slytherins around him were giving him quizzical gazes like he'd just tried
    to explain algebra.
12403:
  text: |-
    "Look better to <em>who?</em> " said the sixth-year boy.
12404:
  text: |-
    "But you just helped a <em>mudblood</em>," said the fifth-year girl. "How's
    <em>that s</em>upposed to look good?"
12405:
  text: |-
    Draco's throat closed up. His brain was experiencing a hideous malfunction
    during which it couldn't think of anything to say except the truth -
12406:
  text: |-
    Then, "It's probably some kind of tremendously clever scheme Malfoy's got
    going," said a fifth-year boy. "You know, like in <em>The Tragedy of Light</em>,
    where everything that looks like a setback is part of the plot. And it ends with
    Granger's head on a stick and nobody suspecting that it was him."
12407:

    "<em>That</em> makes sense," someone said from further down the table, and there
    was a lot of nodding.

    Hermione had left lunch early that day, for some reason she hadn't felt hungry.
    Those few seconds of horrible humiliation had kept burning through her mind,
    over and over, the feeling of her face squishing into the mashed potatoes and
    then being thrown through the air and then the Slytherin's boy's voice saying
    'Apologize to me'... it might have been the first time in her whole life that
    she'd felt like <em>hating</em> someone. The boy who'd thrown her (Marcus Flint,
    they'd said his name was) and whoever had cast the tripping Jinx on her in the
    first place... she'd felt it, for one horrible instant she'd wanted to go tell
    Harry that if he started getting <em>creative</em> on her behalf, she wouldn't
    object.
12413:

    She hadn't been a minute out of the Great Hall before she'd heard the sound of
    running feet behind, and turned to see Daphne racing toward her.
12414:
  text: |-
    And listened to what her Sunshine Soldier had to say...
12415:
  text: |-
    "Don't you <em>understand?</em> " Daphne's voice was barely below a shriek.
    "Just because someone's nice to you doesn't mean they're your friend! He's
    <em>Draco Malfoy!</em> His father's a Death Eater, all the parents of all his
    friends are Death Eaters - Nott, Goyle, Crabbe, <em>everyone around him</em>, do
    you get it? They <em>all</em> despise Muggleborns, they want everyone like you
    to <em>die</em>, they think you're good for nothing but being a
    <em>sacrifice</em> in horrible Dark rituals! Draco is <em>the next Lord
    Malfoy</em>, he's been raised from birth to hate you and he's been raised from
    birth to <em>lie!</em> " Daphne's gray-green eyes stared fiercely at her,
    demanding assent and understanding.
12416:
  text: |-
    "He -" Hermione said falteringly. She remembered the rooftop, the awful jolt as
    she started to fall, Draco Malfoy's hand grabbing hers and holding it so hard
    that she'd had bruises afterward. She'd had to tell him twice before he finally
    let her fall. "Maybe Draco Malfoy isn't like them -"
12417:
  text: |-
    Daphne's whisper was almost a scream. "If he <em>doesn't</em> end up doing you
    ten times as hard as he just helped you, his <em>life</em> is <em>over</em>, do
    you understand? I mean Lucius Malfoy would <em>literally</em> disinherit him!
    D'you know what the chance is that he's <em>not</em> up to something?"
12418:

    "Tiny?" said Hermione in a small voice.
12419:

    "<em>Zero!</em> " hissed Daphne. "I mean <em>none!</em> I mean <em>less</em>
    than zero! I mean the chance is so small that you couldn't find it with three
    Magnifying Charms and a Point-Me spell and - and - and an ancient map and a
    centaur prophet! Everyone in Slytherin knows he's plotting to do something to
    you and doesn't want to be suspected, I heard someone say he was seen pointing
    his wand at you just before you tripped - don't you <em>see?</em> <em>This is

    "You want to know my plot?" said Draco. "<em>Here's</em> my plot. I'm not going
    to do <em>anything</em> and then the <em>next</em> time people think I'm
    plotting something, they won't be sure."

    "That's what he <em>wants</em> you to think," said the fifth-year girl.

    "What do you mean, <em>set you up?</em> " said Millicent. The two of them were
    sitting cross-legged on Daphne's bed, having come there straight from the Great
    Hall after lunch. "With my Seer's eyes that stare through Time Itself, I saw you
    <em>winning</em>."
12429:

    Daphne stared at Millicent, her own merely mortal eyes rather narrowed at the
    moment. "That boy was <em>expecting</em> us."

    "Well, yeah!" said Millicent. "Everyone knows you're hunting bullies!"

    "Hannah got hit by a really painful hex," Daphne said. "She had to visit a
    healer, Millicent! If we're friends you should've <em>warned</em> me!"
12432:

    "Look, Daphne, I <em>told</em> you -" The Slytherin girl paused, as if trying to
    remember something, and then said, "I mean, I told you, what I See <em>has</em>
    to come to pass. If I try to change it, if <em>anyone</em> tries to change it,
    really terrible, awful, no good, extremely bad things will happen. And then
    it'll come to pass <em>anyway</em>. If I See you getting beaten up, I
    <em>can't</em> tell you that, because then you'd try to <em>not go</em>, and
    <em>then</em> -" Millicent stopped.
12433:
  text: |-
    "And then?" Daphne said skeptically. "I mean, what happens if we just don't go?"
12434:
  text: |-
    "I don't <em>know!</em> " said Millicent. "But it probably makes being eaten by

    "Look, even I know that's not how prophecies work," Daphne said, then paused.
    "At least prophecies don't work like that in plays..." Admittedly, there were
    all sorts of tragedies where trying to avoid a prophecy <em>made</em> it happen,
    or where, on the other hand, trying to <em>go along</em> with a prophecy was the
    only reason why it happened. But you <em>could</em> make prophecies happen your
    own way if you were clever enough; or someone who loved you enough could take
    your place; or with enough effort it was possible to break a prophecy
    outright... Then again, in plays the Seers never remembered what they Saw,
    either...
12436:
  text: |-
    Millicent must have seen Daphne's hesitation, because the other girl started
    looking a little more confident. "Well," Millicent said sharply, "this isn't a
    play! Look, I'll tell you if I See it being a hard battle or an easy one. But
    that's <em>all</em> I can do, you understand? And if I say 'hard' you
    <em>can't</em> not show up! Or - or -" Millicent's eyes rolled back in her head,
    and she intoned hollowly, "<em>Those who try to cheat their destinies will come
    to sad and gloomy ends -"</em>

    Jaime Astorga, seventh-year of Slytherin, and until recently considered a
    promising upstart on the youth dueling circuit, stood ramrod straight in
    Professor Snape's office, with his teeth clenched tight and sweat trickling down
    his spine.
12448:

    "I distinctly recall," said the Head of his House in a sardonic drawl, "that I
    warned you, and a number of others this very morning, that there were certain
    first-year girls who might prove annoying, if a fighter were <em>incautious</em>
    and allowed himself to be <em>taken by surprise</em>."
12449:
  text: |-
    Professor Snape stalked in a slow circle around him.
12450:
  text: |-
    "I -" said Jaime, as more sweat beaded on his forehead. He knew how ridiculous
    it sounded, how much of a pathetic excuse. "Sir, they shouldn't have been able
    to -" One first-year-girl shouldn't have been able to break his
    <em>Protego</em>, no matter what sort of ancient Charm she used - Greengrass
    must have had <em>help</em> -
12451:

    But it was very clear that his Head of House wouldn't believe that.
12452:
  text: |-
    "Oh, I quite agree," murmured Snape in a low tone, instinct with menace. "They
    shouldn't have. I begin to wonder if Mr. Malfoy, whatever his plotting, has a
    point, Astorga. It cannot be good for the repute of Slytherin's House if our
    fighters, rather than demonstrating their strength, lose to little girls!"
    Snape's voice had risen. "It is well that you had the good taste to be defeated
    by a little girl who is a fellow Slytherin of a Noble House, Astorga, or I would
    deduct points from you myself!"
12453:

    Jaime Astorga's fists clenched at his side, but he couldn't think of a thing to

    That evening Draco was visited by his father's owl, Tanaxu, who wasn't green but
    only because there weren't such things as green owls. The best Father had been
    able to find was an owl of the purest silver feathers, with great luminous green
    eyes, and a beak as sharp and cruel as any snake's fang. The parchment wrapped
    around Tanaxu's leg was short and to the point:
12457:
  text: |-
    <em>What are you doing, my son?</em>
12458:
  text: |-
    The parchment that Draco sent back was equally short, and it said,
12459:
  text: |-
    <em>I am trying to stop harm done to Slytherin's reputation, father.</em>
12460:
  text: |-
    In as much time as it took for an owl to fly from Hogwarts to Malfoy Manor and
    back again, the family owl bore another message to Draco, and this one said
    only:
12461:
  text: |-
    <em>What are you really doing?</em>
12462:
  text: |-
    Draco stared at the parchment he'd unwrapped from the owl's leg. His hands
    trembled, as he held up the parchment to the light of his fireplace. Five words,
    carved in black ink, shouldn't have been scarier than death.
12463:
  text: |-
    There wasn't very much time to think. Father knew exactly how long it took for a
    message to go from Malfoy Manor to Hogwarts and back again; he would know if
    Draco delayed to compose a careful lie.
12464:
  text: |-
    But Draco still waited until his hand stopped trembling, before he wrote his
    reply, the only answer he'd thought of that Father might accept.
12465:
  text: |-
    <em>I am preparing for the next war.</em>
12466:
  text: |-
    Draco wrapped that parchment around the owl's leg and tied it, and then sent
    Tanaxu winging out from his room, through the halls of Hogwarts, into the night.
12467:

    He waited, but no reply came.
